### Events ###
mnr.1.t:0 "History of the State"
mnr.1.d:0 "The Mountain Republic was proclaimed at the congress of the North Caucasian peoples on 1st May 1917 in the territory of Dagestan and the mountain districts of the Terek region. In April 1918, the Central Committee of the Union declared independence from Russia with the transformation of the state into the Union Republic of North Caucasian Peoples. Independence was officially declared on May 11, 1918 at a peace conference in Batumi. \n\nAfter the Civil War, in 1922 the state was recognized only by the Don Republic, the Kuban People’s Republic, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and the Reichspakt countries. \n\nSince 1918 the republic was ruled under the presidency of Tapa Chermoyev and his loyal cabinet of mostly conservative ministers. Chermoyev, famous for being the richest person in Mountain Republic, oilman and the creator of the SOG, has strong authoritarian tendencies to save his power, influence and fortune. However, there are various groups in our country that will try to break this idyll."
mnr.1.a:0 "Trying to survive."

mnr.2.t:0 "The Majlis of the Republic"
mnr.2.d:0 "Our Union is divided into 7 national republics, united under one government into the Mountain Republic. As planned, the Majlis of the Republic, the main legislative body of our state, should be divided eqully between 7 nationalities of the Union. However, in real life, this principle of equality was violated with the government of Chermoyev lobbying the Chechen majority in the Majlis. This leads to the situation when the majority of bills were approved in favour of the Chechens, developing and enriching their region. There are 2 main fractions in the parliament: the ruling coalition of democrats, SOG, and the opposition, consisting of few socialists."
mnr.2.a:0 "Interesting..."

mnr.3.t:0 "New Oil Field Discovered"
mnr.3.d:0 "A new oil field has been discovered in the Grozny region. As always, it has been quickly privatized by president Chermoyev and his oil company "CNZ"."
mnr.3.a:0 "The social inequality continues to grow in the republic..."

mnr.4.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Mountain Republic"
mnr.4.d:0 "The Berlin stock crisis has reached us as well. Many German investors have already withdrawn their assets from our country, the government of German Kaiserreich has also increased the import prices. It seems we can now only rely on ourselves."
mnr.4.a:0 "Another crisis..."

mnr.5.t:0 "Changing The Majlis Quotas"
mnr.5.d:0 "We need equal representations of the 7 nations in the Majlis. Now, the majority of seats are held by Chechens, while others are lacking representations. We need to ensure that quotas are respected, so that the seats in the Majlis are equally divided between 7 nations. President Dzhabagiyev introduced the legislative bill of Nations Equality in the Majlis. While the majority of seats are held by SDPSK, at the same time the majority of our deputies are Chechens who will try to suppress the bill or join opposition."
mnr.5.a:0 "The Bill passes!"
mnr.5.b:0 "Chechens block the Bill."

mnr.6.t:0 "OKSP in the Government?"
mnr.6.d:0 "In order to rebuild our Caucasian democracy after 20 years of Chermoyev's rule, we will need to pass some socialist reforms. We shall invite OKSP in our government coalition and work together."
mnr.6.a:0 "We need their help."

mnr.7.t:0 "Unrest in the Army"
mnr.7.d:0 "With the news of OKSP gaining more power, there has been seen a large unrest in our military forces. General Tarkovsky, an influential figure among the conservatives has openly criticized president Dzhabagiyev. There are rumors that Tarkovsky even plans to coup the government if it becomes too 'socialist' in his view. We need to deal with the unrest as soon as possible"
mnr.7.a:0 "He can do nothing against democracy."
mnr.7.b:0 "Promise to increase military budget."

mnr.8.t:0 "An ultimatum from Tarkovsky"
mnr.8.d:0 "Tarkovsky unites Dagestani nobility and nation and mobilizes against our government. He sent us an ultimatum to immediately ban OSKP from the government, otherwise he will be ready to seize the power in the country to stabilize the nation using forces."
mnr.8.a:0 "Democracy will always win, ignore Tarkovsky."
mnr.8.b:0 "Stability is more important: give up."

mnr.9.t:0 "Large Unrest in the Dagestan"
mnr.9.d:0 "We have lost control of the Dagestan - the anti-government forces, united by Tarkovsky have seized administrative buildings and are going to declare independence. The situation is critical. If we immediately do not stop with socialist reforms, we can face a civil war. What shall we do?"
mnr.9.a:0 "We will not give up."
mnr.9.b:0 "Prepare our forces."
mnr.9.c:0 "President Dzhabagiyev retires."

mnr.10.t:0 "Reform the Electoral Code"
mnr.10.d:0 "Our country needs reforms in the electoral code, as the majority of our population, especially women still lack the rights to vote. While this reform can gain us a lot of support from the peasants and workers, the conservaive classes of our country will be very disappointed."
mnr.10.a:0 "It is too dangerous to pass this reform now."
mnr.10.b:0 "Pass the bill, off with the old order."

mnr.11.t:0 "Oil Industry Nationalized"
mnr.11.d:0 "The key source of income of the influential Chermoyev's family is oil industry. However, by enriching them, the state remains poor. With oil industry nationalized we can ensure that our country will develop and become richer."
mnr.11.a:0 "Oil belongs to people."

mnr.15.t:0 "Media Crackdown"
mnr.15.d:0 "The clandenstine organizations, operating in the republic and OKSP are sharing socialist literature with propaganda of syndicalism, socialism and other spoilt ideologies, harmful for our conservative society. We need to install press censorship to block this agenda from our society."
mnr.15.a:0 "Freedom of speech, but not for socialists."

mnr.16.t:0 "Socialist Unrest"
mnr.16.d:0 "There is news about large socialist unrest in Dagestan. The protesters demand fair elections, equal representation of nations in the Majlis, 8-hour work day and increased wages. The leader of OKSP, Korkmasov has held a speech in the Majlis, denouncing current government and fiercly criticizing the media censorship."
mnr.16.a:0 "Ignore them."
mnr.16.b:0 "Lift the ban for now."
mnr.16.c:0 "Our measures were insufficient, ban the OKSP!"

mnr.17.t:0 "Clashes in Vladikavkaz"
mnr.17.d:0 "After the OKSP banned, the socialists have gathered in center of Vladikavkaz, in front of the Majlis building to protest against the government. The protest is becoming more and more violent with mass public disorder. Chermoyev has announced his total loyalty to Republic and that he will stop the anti-constitutional uprising whatever it takes."
mnr.17.a:0 "Order the army to enter the city."
mnr.17.b:0 "They will calm down soon."

mnr.18.t:0 "The Army Has Entered Vladikavkaz"
mnr.18.d:0 "With army entering Vladikavkaz, some parts of the protesters have run away in panic, but the majority, however, stayed strong at the Ploschad Svobody square. The army is waiting for President's order."
mnr.18.a:0 "Shoot them."

mnr.19.t:0 "The Army Brings Down Fire"
mnr.19.d:0 "The soldiers began to shoot in the air. With the first shot heard, the protesters divided into two. The ones tried to run away from the square, however, being immediately captured by the army. The others stayed, seen building barricades at the square. With army surrounding the square, the fight becomes inevitable. However, the protesters have nothing to do against armed soldiers of the Mountain Republic. General Tarkovsky ordered the protesters to surrender.\n\nSuddenly Korkmasov appeared in front of the protesters. He told them to calm down and go home to prevent bloodshed. After he ended his speech, general Korkmasov approached him and arrested."
mnr.19.a:0 "We stopped the uprising. Let's get down to business."

mnr.20.t:0 "The Protesters Seize the Majlis."
mnr.20.d:0 "The angry mob has entered the Majlis building, seizing it and constructing barricades around the building. Chermoyev is said to have left Vladikavkaz for Grozny. With Vladikavkaz in protesters' hands, the police is joining the socialists. Korkmasov has declared himself the acting president of Mountain Republic."
mnr.20.a:0 "It seems that socialists are about to win."

mnr.21.t:0 "Socialist Victory!"
mnr.21.d:0 "With Chermoyev escaping, the police joining the rebels, Korkmasov has declared the victory of the OKPS. He has also proclaimed the creation of the Socialist Republic."
mnr.21.a:0 "We have a lot to do."

mnr.22.t:0 "Insurgency in Chechnya and Dagestan"
mnr.22.d:0 "Soon after Korkmasov announced victory, the autonomous republic of Chechnya and Dagestan refused to recognize the self-declared president and his government. There are protests in major cities of Grozny and Makhachkala. We need to suppress the uprising as soon as possible!"
mnr.22.a:0 "Well, not all revolutions are peaceful."

mnr.23.t:0 "Tarkovsky Coups the Government!"
mnr.23.d:0 "With the overall support of our government having become too low, general Nukh-Bek Tarkovsky has managed to overthrow the current government. He's likely to install a dictatorial authoritarian regime now, willing to unite the nation, which has been broken into separate peaces by the previous government."

### Events ###
khiva.1.t:0 "The Khanate of Khiva"
khiva.1.d:0 "The Khanate of Khiva has been a Russian protectorate since 1873. However, after the 1917 February Revolution in Russia, the liberal reforms, as planned, were not performed due to the conservative views of the Khivan Khan Isfandiyar. Later he was assassinated and the power has eventually been seized by the leader of the tribe of Turkens, Junaid Khan. He placed Sayid Abdullah, younger brother of Isfandiyar as a puppet monarch,. Junaid Khan himself became a Vizier, but he's been the head of Khivan state for all these 18 years de facto. His aggressive foreign policy led to terrible defeats against the Reds. But, the forces of communists were not enough to defeat the government. The Reds were defeated in Russia and Junaid Khan consolidated his rule as the dictator of Khiva. For 15 years he conducted conservative and autocratic policy that helped Khiva to remain an agrarian, nomadic country in the middle of desert. The opposition to the regime of Junaid Khan has been growing all these years and it is becoming very dangerous for a 79-year old dictator, who can barely control the country."
khiva.1.a:0 "Khiva Lives On!"

khiva.2.t:0 "Junaid Khan Is Dead!"
khiva.2.d:0 "The Vizier of Khiva, Junaid Khan has died of stroke at the age of 79. Sayid Abdullah, Khan of Khiva, has now to decide who should he make the new head of government. While Khan himself is a poor leader, as he has been a ceremonial figure for almost 20 years, he believes he is strong enough to install absolute monarchy in the region, asking the Emir of Bukhara for support. On the other hand, Khiva is in a strong need of modernization, and perhaps making the leader of Young Khiva Party a new Vizier will only benefit the Khanate. The third choice is to make Shir Muhammed-bek Gazi, an honorable Khivan general and the main representative of the Basmachi movement in Khiva, the new grand Vizier."
khiva.2.a:0 "Bobo Ahun, Young Khiva leader."
khiva.2.b:0 "Shir Muhammed-bek Gazi, the leader of Basmachi."
khiva.2.c:0 "The Khan consolidates his rule as absolute monarch."

khiva.3.t:0 "Bobo Ahun Demands Consitutional Monarchy"
khiva.3.d:0 "The new Vizier, Bobo Ahun demands that Sayid Abdullah has to adopt the constitution and divest himself of authority as an absolute monarch. While Khan is shocked to hear about the Vizier's proposal, he believes that the Khanate needs modernization. But if the Khanate needs radical modernization of Bobo Ahun, or should it be modernized gradually by the Khan himself?"
khiva.3.a:0 "He is reasonable. Khan should be a constitutional monarch."
khiva.3.b:0 "This is nonsense. Khan should stay an absolute monarch."

khiva.4.t:0 "Young Khiva Revolution"
khiva.4.d:0 "Outraged by the Khan's words and his unwillingness to change Khiva, the Young Khiva Party has organized mass protests in the city of Nukus. The Khan has mobilized the Basmachi to disperse the crowd, but the power of revolutionnaries is only growing."
khiva.4.a:0 "Send Basmachi"

khiva.5.t:0 "Armed Conflict in Nukus"
khiva.5.d:0 "There are reports about armed conflicts between Young Khiva protesters and the Basmachi, led by Shir Muhammed-bek Gazi. The streets of the ancient city are covered in blood. It seems that the bloodshed cannot be stopped."
khiva.5.a:0 "Agree to the Young Khiva's demands."
khiva.5.b:0 "Mobilize more forces in Nukus."

khiva.6.t:0 "Young Khiva Victory"
khiva.6.d:0 "The Basmachi were completely destroyed in Nukus with Young Khivans raising the flag of liberated Khiva. Their braveness has encouraged other citizens in Khivan cities and today the forces of Sayid Abdullah were crushed as well. The Khan has been forced to abdicate and Young Khiva Party has declared the Republic of Khiva."
khiva.6.a:0 "Long Live the Khivan Republic!"

khiva.7.t:0 "Basmachi Victory"
khiva.7.d:0 "The Young Khiva protesters were completely destroyed in Nukus with Basmachi burning the republican flags. Sayid Abdullah, khan of Khiva has congratulated Basmachi on victory and offered Shir Muhammed-bek Gazi the office of Vizier. Now nothing can stop Khiva from respecting the tradition."
khiva.7.a:0 "Long Live the Khanate!"

khiva.8.t:0 "First Khivan Elections"
khiva.8.d.rep:0 "The first elections are to be held now. There are not many candidates in the young republic, however. The first faction is the moderate wing of Young Khiva, led by Bobo Ahun himself, and the second one is the liberal wing, led by Palvan-Niyaz Yusupov."
khiva.8.d.mon:0 "The first elections are to be held now. There are not many candidates, however. The first faction is the moderate wing of Young Khiva, led by Bobo Ahun himself, and the second one is the conservative wing, led by Palvan-Niyaz Yusupov."
khiva.8.a:0 "Young Khiva Moderates!"
khiva.8.b:0 "Young Khiva Liberals!"
khiva.8.c:0 "Young Khiva Conservatives!"

khiva.9.t:0 "Young Khiva Victory"
khiva.9.d:0 "Young Khiva Party, led by Bobo Ahun stayed victorous in the Khanate of Khiva. While Khiva is finally opened to modernization, we will probably loose an ally. Young Khiva movement can probably provoke the Young Bukhara Party to rebell as well, as their unfluence is getting stonger."
khiva.9.a:0 "Perhaps we should ally Young Bukhara before they rebel as well."
khiva.9.b:0 "Strengthen the power of Basmachi in the region."
khiva.9.c:0 "Congratulate the new Khivan Government."

khiva.10.t:0 "Basmachi Victory in Khiva"
khiva.10.d:0 "Young Khiva Party, led by Bobo Ahun was crushed in the Khanate of Khiva. The power in the Khanate has been transferred to the Basmachi, and this means we can still rely on Khiva in case of war with Kokand. Young Khiva loss can probably provoke the Young Bukhara Party to rebell as well, as their unfluence is getting stonger."
khiva.10.a:0 "Congratulate Basmachi in Khiva"
khiva.10.b:0 "Poor news."

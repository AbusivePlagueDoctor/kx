### Leaders ###
POLITICS_JACQUES_ROMAIN_DESC:0 "Jacques Roumain prolific poet, once a close associate of both liberal and Noiriste writers alike, together with a close-knit group of like minded ideologes, founded the Haitian Syndicalist Party and began the formalisation of the fragmented Haitian left. While he would alienate his liberal and Noiriste once-allies in the process, the movement he would create propelled him to the forefront of opposition to the authoritarian regime of Louis Borno."
POLITICS_GEORGES_RIGAUD_DESC:0 "A leader of protests against the discriminatory policies the United States imposed upon Haitian education system, Rigaud was beaten to inch of his life at the hands of American Marines as a young student in Port-Au-Prince. Soon thereafter, as a leader of the burgeoning labor movement, while others within the Haitian left would embrace fully European ideas of socialism, Rigaud would instead attempt to mold syndicalist ideas to fit the unique history and culture of Haiti."
POLITICS_LOUIS_BORNO_DESC:0 "In 1922, Louis Borno was elected in a seeming act of defiance by the Council of State against the occupying Americans. Borno, however, would prove entirely willing to not only cooperate with the United States, but work hand in hand to ensure their mutual success. During the occupation, Borno, with the approval of Marine General John Russell and the United States, managed to eliminate Haiti's crippling debts, complete unprecedented infrastructure projects, and stabilise the country's political turmoil. With the end of the occupation amidst renewed unrest, Borno was allowed to retain the presidency.\nDeeply Catholic and despite his willingness to work with the United States, Borno's authoritarian reign has also seen a good deal of social change, especially regarding the status of Kreyol. As he looks to the future, the aging President Borno is faced with threats to his rule both from within Haiti and without, and his successes and failures alike will undoubtedly shape Haiti's future political landscape for years to come."
POLITICS_JOHN_RUSSELL_DESC:0 "General John Russell's long tenure as American Marine Commissioner for Haiti suffered only a minor hiccup with the withdrawal of American Marines from the country, still keeping a close eye on the affairs of Haiti's civilian government. While sympathetic to the Haitian people and holding surprisingly tolerant racial views, Russell is loyal only to the United States."

### Events ###
haiti.1.t:0 "The American Commission Pulls Out!"
haiti.1.d:0 "For twenty long and onerous years, our so-called ‘benefactors’ from the United States pressed their boot into the people of our island nation, their black mark leaving a stain on the pristinely white beaches we call home. Under their watch, Haiti was both uplifted and downtrodden as the Americans and their puppet in President Louis Borno raped our nation’s land and ransacked our economy for their own gain, all under the false and dangerous pretense of ‘nation building’ and ‘preserving the peace.’ As the new year dawns, we find ourselves staring into a Spring in which we are not on Washington’s leash for the first time in two decades, and with our new freedom comes the potential for both great successes and terrible failures. To begin our new journey, the most pressing issues must be handled first. Chief among these new concerns would be what to do with the remnants of the American Commission, and the numerous inquiries into our State that they were administering before their hasty departure in the wake of Black Monday. Our former overlords were in the middle of conducting numerous Commissionary investigations, enacted by now infamous President Herbert Hoover, into our state’s handling of issues in agriculture, political freedoms, economic mobility, and the biggest plague of them all, our rampantly corrupt and grossly inefficient education system. While the original investigators are all long gone, their work and findings remain here, still unfinished, offering an opportunity to pick up from where they left off so that we ourselves may probe into Haiti’s myriad of issues. These half-finished reports are not all the Yankees left us however, with much of the infrastructure, administrative systems, and other bureaucratic amenities of the Commission and the occupying force being left standing and still in well-working and usable condition. These bounties have left our administration with a choice: either mothball these facilities and unfinished inquiries, relegating them to be demolished or forgotten, or pay the steep price in upkeep in order to finish these probes and renovate their facilities for our own uses."
haiti.1.a:0 "We do not need these remnants of our oppressors. Demolish the remaining facilities and scrap the investigations."
haiti.1.b:0 "They have just abandoned a treasure trove of useful information and equipment for our state. How could we pass this opportunity up?"

haiti.2.t:0 "A New Normal"
haiti.2.d.nofacilities:0 "With our recent reforms to our education system going smoothly, particularly in regards to our agricultural curriculum thanks to the early successes of SNPAER, and the recent demolition of the last remaining marks of the American Occupation, Haiti has ushered in a new era of normalcy and calm. Throwing off the yoke of our former imperialist oppressors once and for all, the proud Haitian republic can now march unhindered in its quest to drag our island home into the modern age. With nationalist groups appeased over our recent anti-American actions and the farmers appeased with their new reforms, it seems a brief atmosphere of peace has been achieved, with our administration now moving to ensure this placid state lasts as the nation carries on with its agenda."
haiti.2.d.facilities:0 "With our recent reforms to our education system going smoothly, particularly in regards to our agricultural curriculum thanks to the early successes of SNPAER, and with the last of the former-American facilities being full renovated, it seems our proud republic has managed to achieve a new sense of normalcy in defiance to our usually turbid history. As we continue the probes into our problems the Yankees commissioned and integrate the newly-redone infrastructure directly into the state apparatus, we shall be able to continue where they left off and further push Haiti into the 20th century. Though our confiscation of these old American assets has greatly disturbed both the nationalist and socialist radicals that chomp at the bit for their chance to strike, a placid peace has still been ushered in. Now it is up to the current regime to maintain this air of calm, lest Haiti collapse back into the fires of abnormality yet again."
haiti.2.a:0 "Though some still doubt our work, we shall march defiantly into a normal future."
haiti.2.b:0 "With normalcy achieved, the great Haitian state can look towards its future without dread."

haiti.3.t:0 "Integrating the Jesuit Schools"
haiti.3.d:0 "As our government goes about the process of reforming Haiti's neigh nonexistent Education system, the inescapable question of what to do with the various Jesuit schools that dot the Haitian landscape has finally come into full focus. These schools, run by the Society of Jesus, are one of the few places a Haitian can get a quality education, however they also taint the minds of our youth with Roman Catholicism. While the majority of the population is Catholic, the question for what to do with the schools is a highly contested issue within the halls of power. Many with Catholic leanings wish for us to begin publicly funding the Jesuit schools. They argue that with public funding, not only will the good work they do spread, but core Haitian values that spring from Catholicism will spread along with good education. Secularists and many more left leaning members of our government argue for the nationalization of the schools, perhaps maintaining the same staff but throwing out any mention of Catholicism or religion outside of historical and cultural references. A third option, supported by hardly anyone is too simply ignore the Jesuit schools, and focus on building a good public education system, saving time and money in the process."
haiti.3.a:0 "The conservatives are right, the Jesuit must be state sponsored!"
haiti.3.b:0 "The leftists are right, only a secular school system is fit for our free Haiti."
haiti.3.c:0 "The Jesuit schools are a waste of our time! We need to focus on building up our own schools!"

haiti.52.t:0 "Noiriste Outrage"
haiti.52.d:0 "Our decision to back down in the face of Dominican brutality has angered many. As a result, voices within the identitarian 'Noiriste' movement have grown in strength, with many ordinary citizens embracing their destructive ideology."
haiti.52.a:0 "Worrying."

haiti.53.t:0 "Noiriste Surge"
haiti.53.d:0 "The Noiriste movement continues to grow in popular support and our efforts to eliminate the movement's leaders have so-far failed. Something has to give."
haiti.53.a:0 "This Must Be Stopped."

haiti.54.t:0 "Noiriste Coup"
haiti.54.d:0 "While the Garde has for so long attempted to root out the Noiristes, it seems they have now revealed themselves - and with guns in their hands at that. Port-Au-Prince has erupted into street battles between Noiriste and the Garde, with the Noiristes slowly working their way towards the city centre and our government."
haiti.54.a:0 "The Coup Succeeds."
haiti.54.b:0 "The Coup Fails."

haiti.55.t:0 "Haiti asks to join the Internationale"
haiti.55.d:0 "When Haiti gained its independence from France, few expected the country to ever align itself with its mother country again. For its part, Haiti seemed to prefer being on its own. However, to our shock, they have asked to join our alliance. Should we accept this offer?"
haiti.55.a:0 "Yes! We can use the help"
haiti.55.b:0 "They are not worth the trouble..."

haiti.56.t:0 "Haiti asks to join the Entente"
haiti.56.d:0 "In a shocking move today, Haiti has requested entry into the Entente Alliance. Leaders from Canada and France have been divided on what the response should be to this request, but it is clear that their entry could serve as another step to controlling the Atlantic. Should we allow them entry?"
haiti.56.a:0 "Yes, they will serve as a useful base..."
haiti.56.b:0 "We have no use for these troublesome Haitians!"

haiti.57.t:0 "Haiti asks to join the Reichspakt"
haiti.57.d:0 "A strange offer has come to our shores today from Haiti of all places. They are requesting entry into our alliance, citing a common enemy in the form of France. Should we allow this impoverished nation into our mighty alliance?"
haiti.57.a:0 "One more couldn't hurt..."
haiti.57.b:0 "We do not need another drain on our treasury!"

haiti.58.t:0 "Creation of the Pan-African Movement"
haiti.58.d:0 "Pan-Africanism has existed as a movement for decades, but never before have the ideals of Pan-Africanism had so much power as they do now in Haiti. Under the leadership of Papa Doc, we could create a truly African state for African people, and march forth as one people, united under one banner. Should we take this opportunity to create our own faction?"
haiti.58.a:0 "Yes, we must be vigilant against our foes!"
haiti.58.b:0 "We do not want to anger the major powers..." 

haiti.59.t:0 "Fate Of The Dominican Republic"
haiti.59.d:0 "The occupation has proven costly, and we must now decide the Dominican Republic's final fate. Some call for its total annexation, while others insist that it should merely become a puppet state again, this time with closer supervision and control."
haiti.59.a:0 "Keep them as a closely supervised Puppet."
haiti.59.b:0 "Work on Integration."

haiti.60.t:0 "Crisis at the Dominican Border"
haiti.60.d:0 "The border region between the Haitian Republic and the Dominican Republic has long been an amorphous and near-lawless region as the borders continue to shift with the sovereign of any particular parcel of land in the region belonging to either side at any one time or another. This constant state of flux has only been worsened by the fact that the border region is absolutely full of native Haitians who work in the region, primarily in agricultural industries. Normally this situation is tumultuous but civil, but recently the Dominican Republic’s ruling regime has repeatedly espoused and promoted anti-Haitian rhetoric and has sent troops and police into the border zone to enforce their idea of ‘peace.’ \n\nEven worse, there have been reports from the Haitian worker hovel-town of Monte Cristi in the border region that Dominican security forces have begun to impose harsh policies against our Haitain laborers, and some have even been beaten or killed. If this situation can not be handled and de-escalated through diplomatic means, many fear war will be the only alternative."
haiti.60.a:0 "We must send a peace delegation to Santo Domingo!"
haiti.60.b:0 "We do not need to act yet! Watch the area closely..."
haiti.60.c:0 "This cannot stand, prepare for war!"

haiti.61.t:0 "Haiti Proposes a Deal..."
haiti.61.d:0 "The Caribbean is one of the primary regions of Entente control left in the world, having largely stayed intact in the form of the West Indies Federation. However, given the recent chaos in the Federation, and the comparative stability of our new ally Haiti, it seems that the other islands could learn something from this state. Even better, the Haitians have offered to be assimilated into the West Indies Federation, under the conditions that it be allowed to change the name of the new state as it sees fit and that the capitol be moved to Port-au-Prince. Granting this request could help stabilize the region, and allow us to focus our thin resources elsewhere, but we could also lose our grip on the area in the process. Preempting our hesitation, the Haitian delegation has already offered to further tweak the deal to further suit our interests. They have offered to grant both the Algiers Regime and our administration here in Ottawa full and sovereign control of Suriname and French Guiana, and Guyana respectively, returning these lands to their former colonial masters directly. On top of this, they have also offered to have the West Indies’ navy leave port immediately and set sail for Canadian waters in order to return to our proud command; an enticing offer given our improved state making it no longer necessary to leave the Exiled navy separated. Our options are varied, but time is ticking. What should we do?"
haiti.61.a:0 "Approve the final deal, may our lost navy return to us along with the Guiana Shield."
haiti.61.b:0 "Approve the amended deal, the Guiana Shield returns to European hands."
haiti.61.c:0 "This is all unnecessary..."`

haiti.62.t:0 "The Canadians respond!"
haiti.62.d:0 "Today, our offer to the Canadians has been answered, and the mighty northern nation has decided to accept the offer of its troops and ships along with the South American colonies in exchange for control over the Caribbean. However, this deal was accepted more easily than our diplomats originally imagined, and perhaps we could ask for more concessions. Doing so, however, could endanger the deal..."
haiti.62.a:0 "The deal is fine as is!"
haiti.62.b:0 "Explain why we need the ships here!"

haiti.63.t:0 "The Canadians respond!"
haiti.63.d:0 "To our delight, the Canadians have accepted our offer! We will guard the Caribbean for them using the old West Indies fleet while the rest of the Entente maintains control over the Guinea Shield. This is an amicable deal for all parties involved, and we look forward to a new future for the Caribbean region."
haiti.63.a:0 "Wonderful news!"

haiti.64.t:0 "The Canadians respond!"
haiti.64.d:0 "Much to our dismay, the Canadians have informed us today that they will be declining our offer. It seems they do not trust us enough to control the area, or are otherwise unwilling to give up the vital resources and geographical positions the area has to offer. This is a setback for our nation, but we will march on nonetheless!"
haiti.64.a:0 "Horrible!"

haiti.65.t:0 "The Haitians make a counter-offer"
haiti.65.d:0 "Today we have received a counter-offer from the Haitian government, stunning many of our diplomats who expected an easy deal. Perhaps they saw our willingness to rid ourselves of the West Indies, and know we desperately need a better administration in the area. Regardless, they have requested that we let them keep the ships of the old Federation, so that they will be better able to defend the area for the Entente. Should we accept this counteroffer and lose face?"
haiti.65.a:0 "If we must..."
haiti.65.b:0 "Not a chance!"

haiti.66.t:0 "A Demand for Kreyol Unity"
haiti.66.d:0 "The great Haitian state has grown from a weak and corrupt republic crumbling under American corruption into a beacon of Pan-African unity in our pearlescent Caribbean Sea. However, Haiti is not just African, but Kreyol as well! We forged this culture in the wake of European oppression, taking what good we could from their wretched traditions and fusing it with our own to create something truly unique; a culture befitting our people who were robbed from the home continent. With our regime now raising its mighty flag across this verdant archipelago, we now eye the last eden of Kreyol culture still left languishing under foregin control: Lwizyana. Our Pan-African brothers in the Black Belt Republic now own this land, and it is in our people’s best interests to demand this territory from them, for it is in Papa Doc’s best interests, and Papa Doc is the Haitian people."
haiti.66.a:0 "Send the ‘request’ at once!"

haiti.67.t:0 "A Request for Creole Unity"
haiti.67.d:0 "With our recent acquisitions in our fight for freedom, we now hold large swathes of the American South. With so much land, stability and unity have been key concerns of our administration, especially with the rise of more unruly elements in our more extraneous territories. One such problem area, growing ever more rife with civil unrest, is the former Union state of Louisiana, and a possible solution to our issues has surfaced. A strange and stern request from Haitian president François ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier, noted Pan-African nationalist autocrat, has arrived on our desk. In a strongly worded ‘request’ letter bordering on a demand, this ‘Papa Doc’ has asked for our regime to transfer administrative rights and control of Louisiana in the name of “Pan-African cooperation and Creole unity” in the words of the Haitian dictator. We could fulfil this request, cementing cooperation between the two prominent majority-Black states in the New World, and relieving ourselves of the headache of Cajun rebels and Longist remnants. However, this would also deeply offend many in our young nation, especially the more nationalist elements. How shall we respond?"
haiti.67.a:0 "Acquiesce Papa Doc’s request in the name of unity and cooperation between our two great states."
haiti.67.b:0 "Refuse this madman at once!"

haiti.68.t:0 "The [BBR.GetName] Declines Our Offer!"
haiti.68.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, the [BBR.GetName] has declined our request for Louisiana. It is true that this was a longshot offer, but we were hoping that they would be more willing to work together..."
haiti.68.a:0 "A shame!"

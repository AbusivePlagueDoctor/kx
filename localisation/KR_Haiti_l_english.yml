### Leaders ###
POLITICS_JACQUES_ROMAIN_DESC:0 "Born in June, 1907, to a wealthy family, Jacques Roumain was educated across the world, and eventually became a prolific poet. Though the man was once a close associate of both liberal and Noiriste writers alike, he founded the 'Parti Syndicaliste' together with a close-knit group of like minded ideologues and began the formalization of the fragmented Haitian left. While he would alienate his former allies in the process, the movement he would create propelled him to the forefront of opposition to the authoritarian regime of Louis Borno. Now, as Roumain and his close associate Max Hudicourt look to bring Haiti into a new age of prosperity, but first they will have to face many challenges, with the most prominent challenge being one another..."
POLITICS_GEORGES_RIGAUD_DESC:0 "A leader of protests against the discriminatory policies the United States imposed upon Haitian education system, Rigaud was beaten to inch of his life at the hands of American Marines as a young student in Port-Au-Prince. Soon thereafter, as a leader of the burgeoning labor movement, while others within the Haitian left would embrace fully European ideas of socialism, Rigaud would instead attempt to mold syndicalist ideas to fit the unique history and culture of Haiti."
POLITICS_LOUIS_BORNO_DESC:0 "From his birth in 1865, Louis Borno has had an active life. Growing up in a mixed-race family and having ties to Europe and America that reach back decades, his political career gained steam before finally coming to a head in the early 1920's. In 1922, Louis Borno was elected in a seeming act of defiance by the Council of State against the occupying Americans. Borno, however, would prove entirely willing to not only cooperate with the United States, but work hand in hand to ensure their mutual success. During the occupation, Borno, with the approval of Marine General John Russell and the United States, did his best to build the Haitian economy, but whatever he did, it would be an economy deeply dependent on America to function. With the recent end of the occupation amidst renewed unrest, Borno has been able to remain in charge, but none can say how long this state of affairs will last.\nDespite his years of rule and his original popualrity, Borno is now known as an American puppet, nothing more than a useful instrument for the interests of Washington and New York City. As he looks to the future, the aging President Borno is faced with threats to his rule both from within Haiti and without, and his successes and failures alike will undoubtedly shape Haiti's future political landscape for years to come."
POLITICS_MAX_HUDICOURT_DESC:0 "Max Hudicourt, a man who has barely reached thirty years of age, has already achieved more than most in Haiti will ever dream of. It is this desire for achievement that has motivated him; from writing to law to activism, Hudicourt has not waited for anyone to give him anything, despite being from an elite background. His gift for charisma is perhaps only outweighed by who he knows. Hudicourt has become close with Jacques Roumain, who he has always seem as a sort of mentor, despite being similar in age to the man. The two men have built the Haitian left to the powerful status it holds today, but it seems that only one man could rule Haiti. As such, conflict between Hudicourt and his mentor was inevitable, and now that Hudicourt rules alone, there are few who can challenge his rule. For now, Hudicourt has prevailed, and he will do his best to see that his will is followed in all of Haiti."   
POLITICS_DEMOSTHENES_CALIXTE_DESC:0 "Not much is known about Colonel Démosthènes Pétrus Calixte's upbringing, other than the fact that he is a Black Haitian who wants the best for his people. Though Calixte has traditionally remained a military figure, specializing in cavalry tactics, he has recently made a foray into the Haitian political scene. Calixte, seeing the rising influence of extremist movements on both sides of the political aisle, has vowed to not allow Haiti to fall into the hands of these groups, especially by military means. For him, standing aside while the Noiristes or the Socialists couped the government would be the greatest dishonor, and so, Calixte acted when he was called upon, and restored order to the people of Haiti. Now that he is in power though, there is much to do before the country can have any sense of stability."
POLITICS_FAUSTIN_MARINE_DESC:0 "Born in 1896 in Pennsylvania, Faustin Wirkus is a strange sight in Haiti. His east Prussian roots make him obviously out of place, but despite this, he has made a home for himself in the country. Originally just a marine in the Garde, so low that he was called a "breaker boy", Wirkus has risen through the ranks, both in the military and in Haiti. In a bizarre 1920 meeting, Wirkus met with several prisoners on the island of La Gonave, including a woman who identified herself as Ti Memenne, the queen of the island. After promising to meet again, the two departed, and it would only be a few years before the two did indeed cross paths once more. This time, Wirkus had sought the woman out in the inland of the island, and after repeatedly applying for duty on the island, he was crowned as the king of the island in 1926 in an elaborate vodou ceremony. Given his first name of "Faustin", the natives took him as the successor to Faustin I, the old ruler of La Gonave who had supposedly promised to return one day. Wirkus has lived up to these expectations, serving as the king of the island for ten years while also upholding his duties as a marine, and in both positions, he is known for his leadership and gentle rule. However, few know of his position as king, and the ones who do think little of it, believing it a curious but otherwise unthreatening title. For his part though, Wirkus, now Faustin II, takes his position seriously, and he has vowed to protect the Haitian people at any cost. \n\n Now that he is in power, he has seized power from the American lapdogs and vows to keep it that way, instead serving as the leader Haiti needs in these times of crisis. Though he plans to gradually unveil his status as the King of La Gonave, he rules as a military man for now, awaiting his opportunity to become the man he was always meant to be..."
POLITICS_FRANCOIS_DUVALIER_DESC:0 "Francois Duvalier was born in April of 1907 to an Afro-Haitian family, and was raised by his aunt. After studying in American and Haitian schools alike, Duvalier became a staff physician. It was in his time as a physician that Duvalier received the nickname 'Papa Doc', but despite his penchant for healing, his interest in politics has been just as prominent in his life. In that realm, Duvalier became interested in Noirisme, Negritude, and Black Nationalism, being one of the founders of the Griot movement and now serving as Carl Brouard's most trusted confidant. Brouard and Duvalier were always a dynamic duo, with both men having an intellectual background and a desire to see Haiti forge its own place in the world. However, the growing incompetence of Brouard coupled with his habit as a drunkard made it clear to all, most of all Duvalier, that action needed to be taken if the regime were to survive. Now that he has dispensed with Brouard, Francois 'Papa Doc' Duvalier rules Haiti with complete control, and Duvalier looks both inwards and outwards to further consolidate his power, whatever it takes."
POLITICS_CARL_BROUARD_DESC:0 "Born in December of 1902 to a mixed background, Carl Brouard always had a promising life ahead of him if he chose to reach out and take it. His decision to become a poet and a political activist surprised none of the people who knew him well, and it is in fact these same people who helped Brouard rise to a position of leadership in Haiti. Brouard's old friend Jacques Roumain may be a rival now, but their affections for one another have kept the peace in Haiti. Other allies such as Lorimer Dennis and Francois Duvalier helped Brouard create a newspaper for their movement, and the three men have been close ever since. Now, as Brouard stands at the head of a nation beset by chaos and misery, he is flanked by his loyal right-hand man Francois Duvalier, though some whisper that it is Duvalier that holds the true power in the regime. As for Brouard, it seems that his ascent to power has been met with a bout of depression and alcoholism, and few are confident that he will be able to last in his current state. The country, and the world as a whole, watch curiously to see if Carl Brouard can do what must be done to stabilize Haiti, or if he will just be another footnote in history."
POLITICS_JOHN_RUSSELL_DESC:0 "General John Russell's long tenure as American Marine Commissioner for Haiti suffered only a minor hiccup with the withdrawal of American Marines from the country, still keeping a close eye on the affairs of Haiti's civilian government. While sympathetic to the Haitian people and holding surprisingly tolerant racial views, Russell is loyal only to the United States."

haiti.1.t:0 "The American Commission Pulls Out!"
haiti.1.d:0 "For twenty long and onerous years, our so-called ‘benefactors’ from the United States pressed their boot into the people of our island nation, their black mark leaving a stain on the pristinely white beaches we call home. Under their watch, Haiti was both uplifted and downtrodden as the Americans and their puppet in President Louis Borno raped our nation’s land and ransacked our economy for their own gain, all under the false and dangerous pretense of ‘nation building’ and ‘preserving the peace.’ As the new year dawns, we find ourselves staring into a Spring in which we are not on Washington’s leash for the first time in two decades, and with our new freedom comes the potential for both great successes and terrible failures. To begin our new journey, the most pressing issues must be handled first. Chief among these new concerns would be what to do with the remnants of the American Commission, and the numerous inquiries into our State that they were administering before their hasty departure in the wake of Black Monday. Our former overlords were in the middle of conducting numerous Commissionary investigations, enacted by now infamous President Herbert Hoover, into our state’s handling of issues in agriculture, political freedoms, economic mobility, and the biggest plague of them all, our rampantly corrupt and grossly inefficient education system. While the original investigators are all long gone, their work and findings remain here, still unfinished, offering an opportunity to pick up from where they left off so that we ourselves may probe into Haiti’s myriad of issues. These half-finished reports are not all the Yankees left us however, with much of the infrastructure, administrative systems, and other bureaucratic amenities of the Commission and the occupying force being left standing and still in well-working and usable condition. These bounties have left our administration with a choice: either mothball these facilities and unfinished inquiries, relegating them to be demolished or forgotten, or pay the steep price in upkeep in order to finish these probes and renovate their facilities for our own uses."
haiti.1.a:0 "We do not need these remnants of our oppressors. Demolish the remaining facilities and scrap the investigations."
haiti.1.b:0 "They have just abandoned a treasure trove of useful information and equipment for our state. How could we pass this opportunity up?"

haiti.2.t:0 "A New Normal"
haiti.2.d.nofacilities:0 "With our recent reforms to our education system going smoothly, particularly in regards to our agricultural curriculum thanks to the early successes of SNPAER, and the recent demolition of the last remaining marks of the American Occupation, Haiti has ushered in a new era of normalcy and calm. Throwing off the yoke of our former imperialist oppressors once and for all, the proud Haitian republic can now march unhindered in its quest to drag our island home into the modern age. With nationalist groups appeased over our recent anti-American actions and the farmers appeased with their new reforms, it seems a brief atmosphere of peace has been achieved, with our administration now moving to ensure this placid state lasts as the nation carries on with its agenda."
haiti.2.d.facilities:0 "With our recent reforms to our education system going smoothly, particularly in regards to our agricultural curriculum thanks to the early successes of SNPAER, and with the last of the former-American facilities being full renovated, it seems our proud republic has managed to achieve a new sense of normalcy in defiance to our usually turbid history. As we continue the probes into our problems the Yankees commissioned and integrate the newly-redone infrastructure directly into the state apparatus, we shall be able to continue where they left off and further push Haiti into the 20th century. Though our confiscation of these old American assets has greatly disturbed both the nationalist and socialist radicals that chomp at the bit for their chance to strike, a placid peace has still been ushered in. Now it is up to the current regime to maintain this air of calm, lest Haiti collapse back into the fires of abnormality yet again."
haiti.2.a:0 "Though some still doubt our work, we shall march defiantly into a normal future."
haiti.2.b:0 "With normalcy achieved, the great Haitian state can look towards its future without dread."

haiti.3.t:0 "Integrating the Jesuit Schools"
haiti.3.d:0 "As our government goes about the process of reforming Haiti's neigh nonexistent Education system, the inescapable question of what to do with the various Jesuit schools that dot the Haitian landscape has finally come into full focus. These schools, run by the Society of Jesus, are one of the few places a Haitian can get a quality education, however they also taint the minds of our youth with Roman Catholicism. While the majority of the population is Catholic, the question for what to do with the schools is a highly contested issue within the halls of power. Many with Catholic leanings wish for us to begin publicly funding the Jesuit schools. They argue that with public funding, not only will the good work they do spread, but core Haitian values that spring from Catholicism will spread along with good education. Secularists and many more left leaning members of our government argue for the nationalization of the schools, perhaps maintaining the same staff but throwing out any mention of Catholicism or religion outside of historical and cultural references. A third option, supported by hardly anyone is too simply ignore the Jesuit schools, and focus on building a good public education system, saving time and money in the process."
haiti.3.a:0 "The conservatives are right, the Jesuit must be state sponsored!"
haiti.3.b:0 "The leftists are right, only a secular school system is fit for our free Haiti."
haiti.3.c:0 "The Jesuit schools are a waste of our time! We need to focus on building up our own schools!"

haiti.4.t:0 "An Unshakeable System"
haiti.4.d:0 "As the sun sets on the era of the American Occupation, a new dawn rises for our state. Dissidents have been routed, the legislature and chamber have been thoroughly shackled, and Haiti stands proud and united for the first time in decades. President Borno’s recent reforms have helped him consolidate his rule while also forging a shared sense of national unity like how a blacksmith would temper fine steel. After reigning for over ten years, President Borno finally rules solidly and firmly, and finally without parroting the orders of a foreigner. Haiti shall march into its new future now unhindered by both detractors and Yankees. Though the current Speaker of the Opposition keeps amassing more influence, and with socialist and nationalist numbers increasing by the day, our stalwart state will not bow in the face of these fools. Haiti marches on!"
haiti.4.a:0 "A foundation of concrete and steel has been forged. Our regime will not falter."

haiti.5.t:0 "A Stable System"
haiti.5.d:0 "As we emerge from the dark age that was the American Occupation, we look back at how far Haiti has come in such a short time. As 1936 dawned, we had just shed the shackles of American oppression as the Haitian people withered under a decrepit and decaying authoritarian presidency. With President Borno’s recent shifts towards democratic ideals however, this withering has begun to be repaired as the fresh growth of republicanism has taken root on our island once more. With our initial reforms going splendidly, Haiti’s government hasn't been this pure and virtuous in decades, and we Haitains look wondrously towards our new destiny: one illuminated by the glow of democracy. The last of the preparations must be planned and finalized, but it won’t be long until fair and free elections finally return to our island paradise."
haiti.5.a:0 "The Haitian Spring has bloomed. True democracy is within arm’s reach."

haiti.6.t:0 "A Face for the Haitian Centre"
haiti.6.d:0 "With the Haitian Republic well back on track towards normal democratic functions and the bulk of our past issues that plagued the legitimacy of our regime now solved, free and fair elections are once again slated to be held. As the planned date draws nearer, the liberal-conservative coalition that serves as the basis of the Liberal Party must now choose an official candidate to field. This candidate will become the face of our varied coalition for years to come, and as such the choice must be made with some care and fairness. As such, an internal election shall be held within our party to determine who shall lead our party in the race for the presidency of Haiti."
haiti.6.a:0 "Jean Price-Mars, liberal titan and father of Haitian Pan-Africanism."
haiti.6.b:0 "Louis Déjoie, prominent industrialist and sugar magnate."
haiti.6.c:0 "Stenio Vincent, proud statesmen and beacon of the dwindling conservatives."

haiti.7.t:0 "Free Elections Return to Haiti"
haiti.7.ds:0 "For the first time in over two decades, free and fair elections are once again being held in the Haitian Republic. Finally, our nation’s democratic-sounding name shall be a lie no longer as true power is vested within the people once more. With all parties being declared legal before the campaigning began, it is expected for the dominated socialist coalition to win out, but the Social Democrats or Liberals could easily act on disunity amongst the far-left in order to seize the win. It is anyone’s race, and as the last of the votes are counted, it seems..."
haiti.7.dns:0 "For the first time in over two decades, free and fair elections are once again being held in the Haitian Republic. Finally, our nation’s democratic-sounding name shall be a lie no longer as true power is vested within the people once more. With the ban on socialist parties still in effect, the race for the presidency is down to two major outcomes: either a Liberal or Social Democrat victory. With the last of the votes coming in, the race is about to be called, and it seems that..."
haiti.7.a:0 "The Syndicalist party, a large coalition of leftist extremists, has won the day."
haiti.7.b:0 "The Social Democratic party wins, shifting us towards a pink creole democracy."
haiti.7.c:0 "The Liberal Coalition wins out, cementing our capitalist roots."
haiti.7.e:0 "The Status Quo is maintained, and the old regime stays."

haiti.8.t:0 "Legalize Political Parties"
haiti.8.d:0 "For years, political parties have been officially banned in Haitian politics, with their members instead organizing into groups that operate outside the official political scene. With this arrangement, these parties actively disseminate their ideals and build their strength, but are unable to actually participate in any governmental capacity. This must be rectified if we are to build a functioning democracy. We have offered amnesty to their members and declared all previously banned parties to now be legal, from the nationalist Noirists inspired by pan-Africanism and the Negritude movement to the Marxist syndicalists and other various leftist groups. Shockingly however, the Noirists have refused our invitation, instead deciding to continue to work outside the official system. The rest of the parties, from socialists to conservatives, have banded together into a semi-official coalition, echoing their previous cooperation as independent organizations. With this step, Haiti inches closer to democracy."
haiti.8.a:0 "Political freedom and expression returns to Haiti."

haiti.9.t:0 "Eliminate Dissent"
haiti.9.d:0 "Our current president’s regime has stood in place for over a decade now, and has only managed to survive by the skin of its teeth, even with the ‘support’ of the Americans. With them gone, we can not afford divisions to be sewn throughout our ranks, for our regime is far too vulnerable and fragile to take much more abuse. From behind our temporary facade of strength, we shall strike at the firebrands and naysayers that have derided and ridiculed the Borno regime for years. Newspapers and radio stations will be censored, offices and safe-houses ransacked, and known or strongly suspected traitors will be arrested en masse; there will be no respite. Each and every one of these enemies of the state shall rot in our nation's jail cells or be forced to toil in our many fields as penance for their action, and if any refuse to come peacefully, they will only be met with a swift and true justice. We will not tolerate these detractors and naysayers any more."
haiti.9.a:0 "Open enemies of the state will no longer run free, spewing their vitriolic lies about our great administration."

haiti.11.t:0 "The Status of the Legislature"
haiti.11.d:0 "Just weeks ago, the American Occupation that has strangled our nation for twenty years collapsed seemingly overnight as the Americans reeled in the face of Black Monday and fled home to cut spending. With our puppet-masters gone, President Borno remains as the leader of the republic, his strings finally cut from his masters. With scores of angry socialists, nationalists, and republicans decrying our administration each day, and with more and more of our general populace growing disillusioned with our rule, Haiti and its legislature stand at a crossroads. Free to govern as we see fit, and with the legislature gaining powers once more for the first time in two decades, a choice must be made: to double-down on our authoritarian ways by dissolving the chamber while also moving to uplift the Haitian people, or we could drift towards democratic principles once more, slowly transitioning the state towards a democratic future. While maintaining our grip and sidelining the legislature would appease many in the newly popular Noirist and Negritude movements, as well as the more conservative republicans remaining in the dying conservative parties, it would also inevitably garner even more hate from the various socialist groups that have exploded in popularity since the arrival of the Yankees. The alternative is no more universally popular, and the drift to democracy and reformation of the council will almost-assuredly anger these traditionalist and nationalist groups as the only competitive parties all having at least a slight-leftist slant. No matter where we take the legislature, we will be walking on glass until our many problems are resolved...or until we collapse underneath them."
haiti.11.a:0 "We shall move towards a democratic and free future! Re-empower the legislature and reform the council."
haiti.11.b:0 "We will continue down our current path and dissolve the chamber to prevent any roadblocks to our rule."

haiti.12.t:0 "Koffeemark"
haiti.12.d:0 "In an attempt to attract the attention of German Investors, the government of [HAI.GetLeader] has begun a new program entitled the "Koffeemark Project." The program is a simple one really, but how it will be carried out is what should be most attractive. In essence all the project is is a dramatic reduction in tariffs and taxes and the like get new investors for our coffee industry. However, in order to get the attention of German investors, the government is creating a series of "Koffeemark Zones" in which the German Mark is the accepted currency and German the only language spoken. While this move is... strange, to say the least, [HAI.GetLeader] hopes it will peak enough attention to get the Kaiserreich's investors interested in the virgin Haitian economy."
haiti.12.a:0 "A strange move indeed."

haiti.13.t:0 "A Truly Haitian HASCO"
haiti.13.d:0 "Among the various relics of the American Occupation stands HASCO, or the Haitian American Sugar Company, a monolith embodying the foreign influence that has perverted the sugarcane industry on Hispaniola for centuries. As we move to continue clearing the Black Mark the Occupation left on our nation, we shall reform and rebrand HASCO to truly work for Haitian interests alone. The conglomerate has been renamed to HSCO, shedding the influence of the Yankees in our agricultural pursuits. The state shall take over general operations, with parts of it being sold off and privatized piece by piece to native Haitians as the opportunities present themselves. The sugar industry in Haiti can now breath free and expand at its own pace, finally free from the shackles of foreign entanglements."
haiti.13.a:0 "The new and improved HSCO shall shed the shell of its American past and work solely for Haitians from now on."

haiti.14.t:0 "Millionaires’ Row"
haiti.14.d:0 "In addition to their occupation forces, the Americans also brought with them Yankee citizens seeking to use our island for their own various ends. The richest of these foreigners settled down in a ritzy neighborhood of high-class housing and apartments in Port-au-Prince, gaining the nickname of ‘Millionaires’ Row’ over time due to the flamboyantly wealthy residents it lured in. Not only did they bring with them their exorbitant fortunes, but also their racial intolerance, instituting a form of segregation in the areas they inhabited and enforced by both corrupt police and American marines. \n\nWith their benefactors and protectors now gone, those who have stayed instead of fleeing with the occupational forces are desperate for an olive branch. We will approach these elites and garner their support, both financial and political, in order to allow these fools to pay back to the nation that has harbored them for so long. However, we must be careful as to not let these benefactors become our next overlords, so they will be kept on a short leash."
haiti.14.a:0 "Yesterday’s oppressor, Today’s lapdog."

haiti.15.t:0 "Achieving Financial Independence"
haiti.15.d:0 "With every foreign benefactor or ‘civilization builder’ that arrives on our shores to do business in our lands, the Haitian people’s pride, independence, and economy are all marked with yet another black stain, each stain further relegating us to be the mere economic playground of other world powers. This ends now! Under a slew of new financial reforms, from new tariffs and trade policies to new foreign-owned property laws and other new policies, all backdoors exploited by these vultures will be sealed, and with it, the gates to our financial independence shall open. Haiti will stand as a mere waystation in the middle of the Caribbean no longer; a new age of economic freedom will be ushered in, and our island nation will serve as a beacon to this new age. The Hatian economy will work for Haitians now, filling our pockets instead of the pockets of greasy fat cats overseas."
haiti.15.a:0 "We will break the tethers that bind us and burst free into the wider world market."

haiti.16.t:0 "Refinancing the Debt"
haiti.16.d:0 "Haiti holds the dubious honor of usually being the poorest nation in North America. Even with Borno’s mildly successful economic reforms and the ‘help’ of the Americans, our island nation still exists in utter squalor, with only the few privileged elites able to rise from the muck that ensnares our nation’s economy. Part of this poverty comes from our immense debt. First tallying up after our revolution against France, our debt has only continued to rise as more ‘benefactors’ lent us money or aid. Though much of the debt to France has been paid off in the many decades since our initial revolution from imperialism, we still owe large sums of money to the United States from the Occupation and, to a lesser extent, to the Kaiserreich, particularly over payments owed to German coffee barons and HAPAG shipping captains. Our administration has decided to reach out to our debtors and refinance our debt to lower our payments and interest rates to more favorable levels. This would allow our regime to reassess and reorganize our incredibly chaotic economic position under a less dire and oppressive situation."
haiti.16.a:0 "We shall reach out to our generous lenders and ask for a fairer deal."

haiti.1600.t:0 "Haiti Seeks Debt Refinancing"
haiti.1600.d:0 "As the ravages of Black Monday and the Great Depression wreak havoc on our own economy and the economies of our neighbors, many pleas for financial aid have reached our shores. Among the more interesting proposals has come in from Port-au-Prince, where the reigning Borno administration has ruled Haiti for decades with American backing. They have asked if we would be willing to sit down and renegotiate their long standing debt to our government, seeking more agreeable terms and less extreme interest rates as they seek to further rebuild their fledgling economy. Though we do not officially reign in Haiti anymore, with the Occupation ending in 1935, their financial strength could still prove beneficial to our state and our lingering business and military interests still left on Hispaniola. How shall we respond?"
haiti.1600.a:0 "We must lift these sanctions if Haiti is ever to truly thrive."
haiti.1600.b:0 "Why should we care about the plight of some Haitians? Deny their request!"

haiti.1601.t:0 "Our 'Benefactor' Responds"
haiti.1601.d:0 "Our "benefactors" in Washington have responded to our refinancing request with a begrudging yes. They have agreed to sit down and hammer out more agreeable terms with our administration. With their help, Haiti’s economy may burst forth into prosperity as the crushing weight of our debt no longer strangles the lifeblood of our finances. Though we still have much to repay, the terms and interest rates are far more realistic for our meager but ambitious economy to manage."
haiti.1601.a:0 "Fantastic! Our economy breathes easy with this burden lessened."

haiti.1602.t:0 "Our 'Benefactor' Responds"
haiti.1602.d:0 "Our "benefactors" in Washington have responded to our refinancing request with a crushing and resounding no. With their denial on our request to negotiate, the oppressive and suffocative debt shall continue to strangle our nation’s economy. Though this won’t be a fatal blow to our aspirations, the economic impact it will have on our finances and industry will be noticeable and crippling for some time."
haiti.1602.a:0 "Damn these economic imperialists! We must find another way out of our financial pit."

haiti.17.t:0 "Supporting the Private Banking Sector"
haiti.17.d:0 "Since the American Occupation and the rise of the Borno regime, much of the capital in Haiti has been centralized into the hands of the BRH, or Banque de la République d'Haïti, which stands as the sole national and Hatian-run bank of our nation. The only other banks that have been allowed to continue operating have been banks run on foregin capital from America, Germany, and France. To restore some good faith to our regime in the public’s eyes while also allowing for economic growth, we should begin to work more openly with these private banks. Not only would it allow more capital to flow into our economy while also appeasing the people, but it would also relieve much of the strain and financial burden of running the state off of our shoulders, reducing our spending dramatically. With the private banks working in unison with the BRH, Haiti’s financial future inches closer to prosperity."
haiti.17.a:0 "The BRH does not need to be the sole Haitian-run bank on the island any longer."

haiti.18.t:0 "Negotiate with HAPAG"
haiti.18.d:0 "The Hamburg Amerikanische Packetfahrt Actien-Gesellschaft, or as it's more commonly referred to as HAPAG, is the dominant player in international and regional shipping in the waters that surround our islands. Making our home sea their ‘Caribbean Lake’, the once successful but comparatively small company has evolved into a monolithic monopoly since their patron nation emerged victorious from the Weltkrieg. Topping the global hierarchy as one of the largest shipping companies on Earth, HAPAG’s dominance in Haiti has never been stronger, with their influence and hold over our economy continuing to grow with each successful route or order they fulfill. Too large and well-backed for us to dare tackle head on, we must go with a more diplomatic approach in order to achieve our goals. We will meet with HAPAG’s chief executives in the region and work out a deal that suits both parties. We will need at least access to their ports, dockyards, and other naval infrastructure if we are ever going to achieve any semblance of self-sufficiency and economic growth in this nation."
haiti.18.a:0 "We must strike a deal with these foreigners in order to secure the economic future of our republic."

haiti.19.t:0 "Dealing with Disloyal Appointees"
haiti.19.d:0 "As we begin to implement our various economic reforms, it is becoming increasing clear that the already passed reforms are being stonewalled. While on paper we may have begun to change and charge our economy, on the ground however, nothing is different. After an investigation by the relevant authorities, it has come to light that a series of bureaucratic officials in everything from the military to the education department are doing everything in their power to overturn our reforms. While not organized, and divided heavily by ideology (mostly radicals, even a handful of American holdouts) they are still a massive threat to any progress. To deal with this, [HAI.GetLeader] has authorized a great purge to deal with these trouble makers. The form of the purge is to be..."
haiti.19.a:0 "...a series of layoffs, nothing too radical."
haiti.19.b:0 "...a series of layoffs, with a few prison sentences to let the people know we mean business"
haiti.19.c:0 "...a series of layoffs, with a few prison sentences and a couple of exeucations. We cannot tolerate dissent within the government"

haiti.20.t:0 "Wresting Control of the Sugar Industry"
haiti.20.d:0 "With our decision to finally deal with the Imperialist who for so long have held Haiti under their iron grasp, it has been decided by the Revolutionary Government that one of our first targets shall be the sugar industry. From the very foundation our nation, the Haitian sugar industry has been owned by foreign imperialists, European fat cats who sit their mansions, sipping tea sweetened by the fruit of the sweat of the worker. No longer shall this continue! Effective immediately, all sugar plantations are to be nationalized and returned to their rightful owners! No longer will the White Man oppress our people, no longer will the fat cats reap what they did not sow. Soon, it shall be the workers sipping tea sweetened his own fruits! As for the landowners themselves, they shall revive their just reward; They shall work until they drop dead, working the mines, the fields, growing the sugar they used without giving a thought to the ones who grew it for them."
haiti.20.a:0 "He who controls the sugar..."

haiti.21.t:0 "Smash the Coalition"
haiti.21.d:0 "With all, or most, political parties now being free to participate in elections and the flowers of free democracy blossoming once again on our island home, our regime has now moved to completely dismantle the current and long-standing coalition of leftist, liberal, and even some of the few remaining and quickly dying conservative parties that banded together in the face of American intervention and Haiti’s slide into soft authoritarianism. With the coalition demolished, the constituent parties, ranging from Maximist and Sorelian zealots to moderate liberals and even the rarer conservatives who have not yet left their parties for the ever-growing nationalist organizations, may now pursue their own individual political agendas. Though only a handful of parties actually stand any chance of winning in a real election cycle, this air of political freedom is just another step on the road to a stable and free system."
haiti.21.a:0 "From the ashes of the coalition, true political freedom and diversity can flourish in Haiti."

haiti.22.t:0 "Cultural Industry"
haiti.22.d:0 "Though we must burst forth into an industrialized and modern future, we must never forget our heritage. The Haitian identity and culture goes back to when the first white-sailed ships first arrived on this island and even sooner in both our native roots here and our African blood from the home continent. Even as we erect great cities and factories and fill the air with black smoke, or as we plow these fields efficiently and for sustenance as opposed to greed, we must never stray from the identity we have fostered and built for generations. It will be woven into our architecture, our policy, our communes. It will echo in every factory and every mine. It will be sung about in hymns as our people work the fields they now all own. Our tradition must never be forgotten; we are creole, we are African, we are indigenous, we are Haitian."
haiti.22.a:0 "Our culture is our identity, it will be the backbone of our new economy."

haiti.23.t:0 "Smashing the Coffee Barons"
haiti.23.d:0 "Our incredibly fertile island is host to numerous plantations and large fields of cash crops that stretch across the landscape, but yet for all the land they use and for all the profits they make, very little if any ever reaches the Haitian people. This practice has gone on for centuries, whether the oppressor be Spanish, French, or American, with none of the benefits going into the hands of the Haitians themselves except for our brief respite of freedom thanks to Toussaint L’Ouverture and his heroics. Currently, the main offenders are rich Haitians and the remaining American and European landowners foolish enough to stay within our borders, and at the top of their hierarchy are the Coffee Barons. Coffee production, along with sugarcane, sisal, and cotton, make up the bulk of all crops grown in Haiti, leading to starvation being an ever present risk for many despite the sheer volume of land devoted to growing crops. To cut the head off this snake, as it were, our new administration, championing the will of the Haitian people, shall strike at these Coffee Barons who sit at the top of the pile and remove them from the equation of our issues. With them deposed and their lands seized by the government for nationalization and their assets redistributed to the people and into government funds, we shall take back centuries of reparations in a single stroke."

haiti.24.d:0 "With the stunning victory of leftist politics liberating the workers and farmers of our poor island home, it is now time to strike back at our oppressors. The American Occupation humiliated our people and disgraced us beyond measure, so now we must build that pride back up. To motivate the people to take back what was stolen from them, our administration has decreed that all true red sons and daughters of Haiti may strike back at our former puppet-masters without retribution from our state. Furthermore, new state action has been planned against the largest vestiges of American influence, promising to clear out these ratnests of Yankee filth while redistributing the seized assets to the people or stashing them away in funds for future state projects. With this announcement, many of the remaining American and European administrators and elites foolish enough to have stayed here this long have fled, with the few left behind facing the ire of our people. Imperialism’s mark will be expunged from our nation forever more."

haiti.25.d:0 "With the victory of the Haitian Proletariat over the Bourgeoisie and their imperialist backers, the time has finally come for the building up of Socialism on Hispaniola to take place. However, there is a small hindrance to the just will of the workers. To say Haiti lacked an urban population would be an understatement, and while the workers do indeed lead our new society, their numbers are fair and few between. In order therefore to both increase our urban population and the amount of workers in the few factories we do have, an ingenuous plan has been concocted. A series of reforms, most notable a litany of tax cuts, have been passed in order to sway the rural populace to begin moving to the cities. Further, preexisting worker syndicates have been granted a large amount of power and autonomy, to finally put the working man in charge of his own industry. A campaign to organize other syndicates has also begun. Slowly but surely the Haitian worker will dig himself out and build a shining beacon to the glory of Socialism for the world to see."

haiti.26.d:0 "Civil conscription, or the forcing of citizens to perform mandatory labor for the state, has a long history in Haiti. Even forgetting our roots in the slave trade, after our independence was won from France, native Haitians were still conscripted by the new Black-led government to carry out hard labor once done by slaves. Though it may have its moral complications to some, our state views it differently. It is part of our history, our culture, as well as being the bedrock of any stable and prosperous Haitian state. Despite its long history here, it is a woefully disorganized and dreadful business that must be modernized and made efficient. New reforms have been enacted to not only give these forced labourers better, safer conditions, but have also concriptied far more of them for our state’s use, chiefly from the many criminals that fill our jails or other lowlifes of our society. It shall be their way of redemption and our way of obtaining free labor to better suit our rapidly growing economy."

haiti.27.t:0 "Overhaul the CFC"
haiti.27.d:0 "The Chemins de Fer de la Caraïbes, or CFC, is the largest rail line in the nation; a relic from the French imperialist regime. Since their departure with our revolution over a century ago, it has received extensions from the Germans, the French, and the Americans all in petty attempts at further exploitation and economic imperialism. With these oppressive regimes now longer calling the shots in our nation, we have an opportunity to overhaul the CFC and create a truly Haitian railway. New, modern engines will be used and the newest advancements in rail and locomotive technology will be imported for our own use, while also allowing our scientists and engineers to attempt to reverse engineer their advancements for our own purposes down the line. This new CFC will rise from the ashes of imperialism and carry the Haitian people into modernity!"

haiti.28.t:0 "Rapid Electrification"
haiti.28.d:0 "Haiti lacks many things most other nations in North America are accustomed to in this modern age, but the most glaring deficit is Haiti’s utter travesty of an electrical grid. With well under half of the nation having any regular access to electricity, and constant electricity only occasionally possible in the largest cities in the nation, much of our populace lives in the dark, relying on more archaic methods to achieve illumination, refrigeration or preservation, cooking, and many other everyday activities. This must be rectified immediately! With our abundance of charcoal, as well as the little amount of regular coal, natural gas, and oil we receive by trade, we must make a concerted effort to light up the night skies of Haiti permanently. With electricity, comes progress!"
haiti.28.a:0 "If we are to be a modern nation, our people can no longer live in the shadows."

haiti.29.t:0 "End the Obsession with Charcoal"
haiti.29.d:0 "Charcoal, or charbon in the local kreyòl ayisyen dialect, is one of the most important industries in Haiti as, due to our crippling lack of natural oil reserves, burning charcoal amounts for nearly all energy production throughout the nation. To fuel this rampant need for charcoal, massive orchards of  Mesquite, Neem, and Kasya trees have been planted across the island, consuming valuable, scarce free land with every seed sown. Though ideally cut above the roots so as to allow the tree to regrow, the quicker practice of lighting entire orchards alight at once has taken off, creating large amounts of usable charcoal that can be further dried and cured after collection in a short period of time. This practice leaves much of the land it leaves behind untillable for quite awhile, slowly eliminating arable land, while also further accelerating our deforestation as new land must be cleared while the old land rejuvenates, or when these fires spiral out of control and spread into Haiti’s few remaining virgin groves. This reckless practice must be outlawed and stopped at once to allow our nation’s forests to heal, instead being replaced with the more sustainable above-the-root cutting method until a better alternative fuel source can be found in ready supply."

haiti.30.d:0 "The Noirisme movement’s influence is felt far and  wide across Haiti, influencing socialists like Roumain, liberals like Price-Mars, and of course the nationalists like Brouard and his protege Duvalier. The movement is a strange fusion of pan-Africanism, nationalism, and populism with racial connotations, vaguely socialist and integralist ties, and a deep disdain for imperialism. This intense fusion of varied ideas are unique to our island home, and has rapidly become one of the most dominant philosophical, artistic, and political strands in the nation. The ideals championed by the Noiristes should be expanded to form the foundation for our new economic system. With the influence of Noirisme, we shall drift further and further into a racially-based populist economy; one that reaches out a hand to help the Afro-Haitians and not the the foul Whites and mixed breeds that have led this nation’s economy for so long and with it, strangled the true Haitain people"

haiti.31.d:0 "Just under a century and a half ago, our forefathers raised their fists in solidarity with one another, marching side by side in their struggle against our old imperial masters in Paris. When our fathers broke their chains, it was not to fold their arms or watch and let their fellow brother toil under them! It was to free all Haitians and elevate them to a position of equality. Though history has played its tricks on our people, and our independence was only temporary and true equality was never achieved, the spirit of these forefathers was never forgotten. As the great Oswald Durand once wrote, ‘Independence is fugitive, without the right of equality! To plough this soil with joy, we need this strict motto: God! Labour! Freedom! ’ We shall make these righteous words echo throughout our regime. True equality shall be granted to all true sons and daughters of Haiti in both economic and political arenas, while the motto ‘God! Labour! Freedom!’ shall help form the core philosophy of our new direction. By infusing our tradition of fighting against injustice with modern concepts, such as from the Noirisme and Negritude movements, we shall create a new economic system that finally benefits true Haitians the most, particularly the most down-trodden of our kin: the Afro-Haitians. Following the spirit of L'Ouverture and Dessalines, Haiti will look to its past as it catapults itself into the future, a future all true Haitians can revel in."

Even now, they further seek to rot the foundations of our new worker’s republic before we can even fully take hold ourselves, and these termites will stop at nothing to achieve their goal of toppling our state from within. This must not come to pass! All those who fill our administrative positions, bureaucracy, or who manage the civil service and affairs of the state in any way shall all be scrutinized under thorough investigation for any reactionary sympathies they may hold. True workers and proletarians have nothing to hide; only the swindlers and conmen of the Right and the Bourgeoisie have anything to truly fear. From the ground up, our entire administration will be swept from top to bottom and cleansed of any traitors to our glorious revolution, and Roumain shall lead the way!"

Who does the watering? Who does the harvesting? Coffee, cotton, rice, sugar cane, caco, corn, bananas, vegetables, and all the fruits, who's going to grow them if we don't? Yet with all that, we're poor, that's true. We're out of luck, that's true. We're miserable, that's true. But do you know why, brother? Because of our ignorance. We don't know yet what a force we are, what a single force - all the peasants, all the Negroes of the plain and hill, all united. Some day, when we get wise to that, we'll rise up from one end of the country to the other. Then we'll call a General Assembly of the Masters of the Dew, a great big coumbite of farmers and we'll clear out poverty and plant a new life.” - an excerpt from ‘Masters of the Dew,’ written and published by Chairmen Jacques Roumain, transcribed to English by one Langston Hughes."

haiti.34.t:0 "The French Model"
haiti.34.d:0 "Though once towering over a world-spanning imperialist empire, the Paris regime now finds itself as the leader of the International and of the global worker’s struggle against imperialism and capitalism; an ironic twist of fate for our former masters. With our state’s recent transition into a truly socialist government, Jacques Roumain, the father of the Haitian revolution and modern leftism in the nation, has shocked the nation and snubbed his nose at the past hatred between our two nations as he has begun to adopt more and more anarcho-syndicalist practices from the Commune of France itself. Using their model as a guideline for how to build up true syndicalism in Haiti, Roumain’s ambitions plans would see the creation of a highly centralized form of democratic syndicalism where communes and worker’s syndicates around the nation would work and maintain their own sectors internally, but would all debate and vote within one larger centralized governing body headed by Roumain himself. Though seemingly far less 'anarcho' and far more 'syndicalist', Roumain and his faction in the Haitian Syndicalist Party believe this to be the only model that will work to finally bring both stability and prosperity to the Haitian people."

haiti.35.t:0 "End the Rivalries"
haiti.35.d:0 "Harsh and venomous political rivalries have long existed in Haiti, even before the Americans came and stirred the unstable pot of Haitian politics. Socialists, liberals, conservatives, and nationalists have all long argued and debated in the chambers of our government while openly brawling or even killing each other in the streets and rural barrens after sessions end. We must mend this rift, lest our nation be torn apart in the process. New and sincere attempts at achieving a dialogue amongst these varied factions is a must, and there is one thing we can all agree on to start these needed peace talks: Haiti is for Haitians, and it must be made that way once and for all. American and European exploitation of our people has gone on for centuries, making our people weak and disgraced. This foul course must be reversed! All the parties and political groups of our nation can agree on that solid fact, and with that shared base point, future political cooperation and bi-partisanship may actually be possible. Max Hudicourt shall lead the way and help guide these warring ideological groups work together to build a stronger and more independent Haiti."

haiti.36.t:0 "Repudiate Radical Noirism"
haiti.36.d:0 "Of all of our political enemies, there is but one we cannot ignore or work with if we are to achieve true prosperity on this island: the Noiriste. These overzealous nationalist fanatics will only cause further trouble as their divisive ideas sow divisions into our ranks. Their siren song lures the disillusioned from both the Left and the Right, and so we must cut the head off this serpent before they lure anymore good Haitians to their damned cause. To confront this nationalistic siren, President Max Hudicourt must decide on one of two plans he has concocted to combat Noirisme’s influence. He could specifically single out the radical Noiristes themselves as the source of the issue, who, in Hudicourt’s words, are perverting the ideas and merits of Haitian culture and using them for their own selfish pursuits. This would likely anger the radical nationalist elements of the movement while still leaving the rest of our support base intact, as we would still support Noirisme and similar strains as a uniquely Haitian cultural phenomena, while cleansing it of its hateful taint. Alternatively, we could flat out denounce Noirisme entirely, hopefully removing its influence from our government for good while also angering a far larger group of Haitians aside from just zealous nationalists. Regardless of our dear leader’s decision, the Noirstes shall remain to be a thorn in our side for some time until our policies and governance shows these lost and wayward sons of Haiti their way back into the flock."

haiti.37.t:0 "Smash the Church"
haiti.37.d:0 "Religion is incredibly pervasive in Haiti, with both Roman Catholicism and native Vodou practices being incredibly common across our island nation. While religion itself is not an issue in Hudicourt’s eyes, organized religion is when it interferes with matters of the state. The Catholic Church has pressed its boot and dulled the minds of the Haitian proletariat since the first missionaries arrived on white-capped ships centuries ago. Since then, the dominance and influence of the Church has only grown, becoming one of the largest non-farmland landowners in the nation as well as sticking its fingers in our coffers as often as it can under the pretense of tithes and other unnecessary nonsense. Our people may still have their beliefs and attend their masses, but the power that Rome and the rest of the Catholic Church has over Haiti shall be stripped at once. Special tax exemptions to Church property and officials will be rescinded, active clergymen will be banned from running for public office or holding government positions, and a secularization campaign will be run by the state to cleanse all Church influence from within the current government. May our people be pious and spiritual, but may the Church never meddle in our affairs again."

haiti.38.t:0 "A Professional Bureaucracy"
haiti.38.d:0 "A new and modern bureaucracy will be needed if we are to efficiently and appropriately run our state. Our new bureaucrats must be loyal to the nation above all else, and will be drafted from loyal civil servants and other proven workers that support our government above all others. This will occur while we actively exclude the myriad of radical groups that flank us on either side. Our new administration shall be an oasis of placidity and diligence in the chaotic maelstrom that is Haitian politics, and we will try to keep our new pencil-pushers as apolitical as possible in order to ensure their professionalism and unbiasedness in their deeply important work. They will each stand as an individual cog in a larger machine, and so each and every cog must be just right."

With emphasis on Haitian music, art, dance, food, writing, poetry, and any other facet of high or low society, this Haitian Renaissance began both in the salons of Port-au-Prince and the slums of Cap-Haitien, uplifting Haitians from across the nation and across regular socioeconomic barriers. Movements like Noirisme and Negritude were popular with many of the artists and performers, while Vodou spiritualism and ideas of “Haitianization” were common as well given their recent rises after the fall of the American Occupation. While the rest of the world readies for war or burns to the ground, for once it is Haiti that gets to dance the nights away as if not a thing in the world was amiss..."

Much like an animal maintaining homeostasis, a nation’s government must also constantly regulate itself, intaking and outputting as needed, in order to function properly. To this end, Démosthènes Calixte has moved to reach out to all political parties within our nation to voice the need for cooperation. What is good for Haiti’s government currently is good for all Hatitans, is his argument, as Calixte’s government stands for all Haitians equally. We will do as an organism would; we will take in the good and expel the bad, taking in advice and thoughts from all sides of the aisle so that Haiti may move forward as one, while also expelling any harmful or uncooperative elements from the equation. Though it will take much time and effort before the cracks separate us are repaired or bridged, Calixte and his government are hard at work, and the results are already beginning to show."

With the collapse of the Borno regime and the establishment of a true democracy here in our state, a process of ‘Haitianization’ must be carried out in order to wipe the American’s taint from our lands. English will once more cease to be spoken on our island as our own dialect of Creole, kreyòl ayisyen, takes hold as the main tongue of our nation, with the dual aims of supplanting basal French and English and driving their imperialist tongues from our lands. The Hatian gourde will be supported to rise past both the Franc and Dollar. Haitian history and culture will be taught in every classroom, Vodou and native Haitian Catholicism will be emphasized, and any other trace of our former oppressors will be wiped clean from Haiti as much as possible. Though the growing pains may be immense as we get acclimated to life on our own and as our own, we must never forget why we are doing this: we do this for every Haitian forced to toil, bleed, or die under the hands of foreigners, for every slave left to die and every servant left to starve. We do this for every Haitian robbed of their homes, their culture, their history, their lives. We do this for all true Haitans, for they above most deserve a free and sovereign home to themselves."

One of his unique ideas is the concept of 'collective bovarysme' which he coined to refer to the small but arrogant group of mixed-races Elites predominantly composed of European-descendant rich landowners. These affluent slobs sit atop the hierarchy of Haiti while over 90% of our nation is of African descent. The Afro-Haitians must be uplifted and given voice and power, while these false sons of Haiti must be cast out and relegated to be ruled by true Black patriots. No longer will we allow a small percentage of our nation to dictate the terms of rule! The time for enfranchisement and the return of their honor is upon all Afro-Haitians across our island home."

A staunch liberal and face of the liberal-conservative coalition that has stood as the bulwark for democracy in Haiti, Price-Mars is one of the most respected men in the nation. Much of this respect comes from his unique array of ideas he personally espouses, while also actively contributing to each movement and idea’s bodies of work. With roots and works published in medicine, ethnology, Pan-Africanism, Negritude, Afro-nationalism, and many other fields, Price-Mars is not only a valued intellectual but also a ture Haitian patriot in the eyes of most people in the nation, regardless of their political affiliation. Due to his reputation and prestige, Price-Mars has become a beacon, attracting former members of our coalition who have been led astray in recent years by the siren song of radicalism. With Jean Price-Mars and other true sons of Haiti like him, our liberal-conservative alliance stands a chance at weathering this storm of radicalization and come out the other side stronger than ever."

Before splitting the hairs on what separates us, one thing above all unites us against all others: we are Haitian. This singular identity is all that keeps us from tripping into complete collapse, but it is no weak bond. Our national pride and heritage is stronger than steel, forged through centuries of oppression, imperialism, and chaos. Our bonds have been forged in a history so tragic many can not bear to reminisce, and with these bonds Haiti is only stronger for it. With our past behind us, we must march into the future together, not knowing what lies ahead.

Long before his reign almost a century ago, the ex-slave turned national ruler Faustin I ruled as ‘Emperor Faustin-Élie Soulouque,Emperor of Hayt’ from 1849 until his forced abdication and exile caused his reign to end in 1859. As Emperor, Soulouque was renowned as a veteran of the Haitian revolution and fair ruler to the poor and downtrodden of Haito. Cleansing the bureaucracy of mixed elites and filling it with black loyalists, embracing Vodou, and creating a secret police, he ruled with a velvet fist, brutal against his opponents and fair to his people. Our noble King Faustin II seeks to emulate his greatness with every waking minute, without the tyrannical reputation that tarnished Faustin I’s reputation forevermore.

From the lowliest Afro-Haitian farmer to the highest Mulatto business tycoon, all are equal and free under King Faustin II. To lessen the plight of these fine people, our glorious king has announced a new series of reforms that will mold the Haitian state into a far more caring nation, granting support, aid, and modern amenities like healthcare and education to all true sons and daughters of our island home.

Their hubris shall be to the benefit of our brothers overseas in the Black Belt who have itched for independence ever since their forced arrival on this continent; a common heritage we share. With our African-descdended brothers in the American south taking up arms, we could throw in with their cause, sending aid and troops at the least, or even possibly direct intervention on their behalf, to aid in their struggle against the tyrannical Constitutional American Republic. However, this would also cast Haitian lives to die in a foreign war, in the land of our past oppressors no less, and would most likely anger a large group of the population, at least until we enlightened them to the righteousness of the Black Belt rebel’s cause.

As the era of slavery and regime of the French Imperialists, or the American Occupation ravaged our nation, our culture slowly blossomed, despite constant attempts at its unrooting. With their shackles broken, the Haitian people were finally allowed to let their traditions openly show, accelerating its growth and further expanding uniquely Haitian ideas first developed under past imperialist regimes, like Noirisme and Negritude, or ‘Creole Communism’ and Pan-Africanism. Even their traditional religions have flourished, with Vodou also making a massive resurgence. All of these modern ideologies and movements have mixed with the traditional native culture of Haiti, and aspects of all of these movements must be drawn from, for not only are many of their varied ideas sound and useful, but also by drawing from all of the varied native Haitian group’s ideas and traditions, we shall be able to create a truly unite and Haitian kingdom under the saviour King Faustin II, the true champion of the native Haitian people.

Though these Yankees still lie in wait, heavily armed and well-trained, we must clear out these ratnests if our rule is ever to fully cement itself.

After hours of bloodshed that lasted until long after the new sun rose in the East, Duvalier’s forces stood victorious, though beaten and bloodied, over the American lapdogs. Though the fighting was fierce and dozens were slain, Duvalier survived the onslaught and called a press conference to address the nation shortly after the smoke cleared the site of the battle. Slamming his would-be assassins and their leaders Franck Lavaud and Gerald Thomas in his speech, Duvalier remarked that if these Yanks spent less time stuffing their pockets and more time training their men with real tactics and discipline, then maybe this group of armed farmers and teenage conscripts might have fared better. Though his speech wasn’t all vitriol, taking a moment to honor the legacy of the few Haitians slain as both a true sons of Haiti and true heroes of the Haitian people, Duvalier has made clear that further actions like this would not be tolerated again, and that next time, the response would not be as cordial.

By striking his fingers in multiple streams of cash flow, Papa Doc seeks to massively increase Haiti’s and his own fortunes simultaneously. Though some of his opponents have voiced their concern over the sheer amount of funds Papa Doc was diverting into his own accounts, these vocal critics soon weren’t heard from again to make much of a lasting impact on the President’s plans.

Pulling inspiration from our Vodou spirituality, Catholic healing techniques, and new modern Haitian science, our doctors and hospitals shall be able to pull from a vast bank of knowledge, both old and new, in order to heal and nurse the many sick and feeble souls who inhabit our nation. Though this has worried some, our loving President ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier has assured all that Vodou is no mere religion, but a philosophy and a science as well. No longer will the lies of our foreign oppressors drag us down and make our people sick, for Haiti’s healthcare system will be cleansed of their corruption..."

haiti.511.d:0 "Deep in the darkest recesses of Haiti’s most run-down and forgotten pits, a dark organization trains young new recruits in secret for their future role as one of the ‘Bogeymen’ of President François ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier. Formally known as the VSN, or Volontaires de la Sécurité Nationale, this fierce force is officially a state-sanctioned militia, but in actuality, they operate as the personal death squads and paramilitary of Papa Doc, acting as the physical manifestation of his will by carrying out only his direct orders. Earning many nicknames over their early deployments and trainings, like the Cagoulards or the Vanpirs, one sticks out among them all: the ‘Tonton Makout,’ or Uncle Gunnysacks, who get their name from the dark Haitian deity known for kidnaping and torturing misbehaving children and stuffing them in his namesake sack for later consumption. Matching the mythological figure of their name, these bogeymen either openly murder or steal away the enemies of Papa Doc, never to be seen again. What they do with their stolen victims is not officially known, but rumors of acid baths, stonings, immolations, and other horrid acts have deterred all but the most foolish to try and verify the claims. With these bogeymen at President ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier’s command, no enemy, vocal or hidden, stands a chance at remaining safe and hidden for long, for the Tonton Makout are on the prowl."

Duvalier reads and writes on many topics, but the art and science of Haitian Vodou is among his favorites. A true and determined practitioner of both the light and dark forces of Vodou, ‘Papa Doc’ has increasingly locked himself away for longer and longer periods of time, supposedly receiving visions as he performs his sacrifices, dark rituals, and black magics to pursue his own aspirations of ever-growing power. Rumors have spread that the young president has even stopped using the traditional animal sacrifices and instead has started using his many enemies and prisoners instead, while others gossip about Duvalier’s propensity to talk to himself or descend into ‘vision-induced seizures’ in certain, less-public settings, which ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier claims is him communing with his ‘Friends on the Other Side.’ Becoming seemingly deranged or unstable, some within our administration have even voiced their concern over Duvalier’s fitness to lead, but these whistleblowers always seem to disappear within a few days or weeks after making noise anyway to be much of a concern. Despite the odd looks he receives and the rumors of his unhinging sanity spread behind his back, none can deny the current successes of the Duvalier regime, which has seemingly been incredibly lucky, or blessed, in the face of the numerous roadblocks his administration has met. Whether these ‘Friends’ really do exist or not is not a question worth asking, at risk of anger ‘Papa Doc’ and becoming one of his rumored sacrifices, as long as Haiti continues this meteoric rise into prosperity."

His sweeping economic reforms of ‘Black Economics’ have made the wounds of Black Monday and the Great Depression become scars of the past and have brought true prosperity to the long oppressed Afro-Haitian people. His nurturing of Haiti’s native traditions and customs have ushered in a golden age of Haitian culture. His skills as a fiery orator and public speaker have earned him scores of new zealous followers with every new rally he holds. 'Papa Doc' holds the Haitian people in the palm of his hand, and many of the masses revere him as a god made-manifest from the Haitian people’s will and love for their President-for-life. As each new day passes, Duvalier may earn more enemies, but he earns far more new supporters and feverishly loyal followers to more than compensate. The Personality Cult of Papa Doc has grown to be larger than the man himself; he has become an idea, an icon, a prophet of the Haitian people and the herald of their coming destiny."

Penning and phoning numerous contacts across the globe, Duvalier has reached out to Mafia contacts in the United States and Italy and the Triads of Shanghai and Hong Kong,  as well as numerous other infamous black market dealers and gunrunners like the Senussi Order and the Mau-Mau to name a few. By building up a reputation and rapport with these fellow brigands and vagabonds, Haiti shall grow prosperous and wealthy.

We need to develop our own designs or, more realistically, procure them through various means from foreign governments so that we may build these awe-inspiring mechchinations of doom for ourselves and use them to protect the Haitian people and to smite our foes.

Guerilla tactics, subterfuge, improvised warfare, and a slew of other ideas will be drawn from and melded together to create a unified doctrine that is specifically formulated for combat where our troops will be fighting and with what they realistically will be fighting with.

Our soldiers were birthed from this land, and now they will train on it, in the thick of the Haitian wilderness or in the density of our largest cities. Every inch of our nation will become known to them, no alley or ditch left unsurveyed and untrained in. Our armies shall learn to live off the land itself, though many already do, in order to truly become one with Haiti whenever foreign beasts come to our shores.

Formed under American oversight and training from the corpse of our previous gendarmerie forces, which themselves replaced our official army in 1916 under American ‘guidance’, the Garde d'Haïti was created with the idea in mind of establishing Haiti’s first apolitical and modern military force while also acting as an arm of the occupational forces. Though their equipment is used throughout our armed forces and their training and doctrine forming the bedrock of all of our current military ideas, it has also created what essentially is a pro-American paramilitary and lobbying entity that barely heeds the word or commands of the state in the wake of the Yankees’ departure. The Garde d'Haïti lobbies for its own interests and policies only those it deems needing policing. We must reel in their influence and autonomy at once, or be forced to watch as these pro-American lapdogs further to taint our island home with the foul tainit of the Americans. The only debate that remains is how we should go about limiting their influence and to what degree. In order to get the Garde to agree to stop or limit their political lobbying, we must reach out to one of Marine Commander Russell’s personal liaisons and confidants. We can appeal to Franck Lavaud, native Haitian general, and further try to Haitianize the Garde while also slowly isolating them from foreign aid, defanging them but also making our only current military weaker. Alternatively, we can appeal to the US Marine commander Gerald Thomas who would keep open our channels and access to American equipment but also likely anger more native Haitians and further strengthen the Garde’s military strength. Though a strong Garde on paper sounds great, they are still a tool of foreign interests and must be monitored."

With the coalition demolished, the constituent parties, ranging from Maximist and Sorelian zealots to moderate liberals and even the rarer conservatives who have not yet left their parties for the ever-growing nationalist organizations, may now pursue their own individual political agendas.

With his departure, a deep hole has been left in the Garde, with it only being able to be filled by one of Russell’s top men.

Despite being a Haitian national, Thomas’ orders and paychecks come from Washington, and with that fact clear to most of Haiti, many have grown resentful of his corruption and mistreatment of the Afro-Haitians, being a Mulatto Elite himself. Surprisingly, an unusual champion for the Haitian people has manifested itself within the young Marine colonel Faustin E. Wirkus. Wirkus has grown famous and loved with the natives of Haiti over his reputation as a man of the people and for his heroic rescue of a native princess on the island of La Gonâve With his adoration growing, he has become a formidable and well respected figure within the Garde itself and wider Haiti at large, and as such as become the nucleus of anti-Thomas action. With the nation’s destiny on the line, Faustin Wirkus along with Garde loyalists and native help, has launched a desperate attempt at a coup to dethrone Thomas as leader of the Garde once and for all.

It has since exploded in popularity as the centuries have dragged on, especially amongst the masses of lower-class farmers, workers, and laborers. Recently, with the departure of the Americans and their distaste for the 'taboo', cockfighting has once again seen a massive resurgence in our lands, with even many in the Garde partaking in the sport due to the lax in restrictions as more and more high-profile Yankees leave our nation. Even further, the largest cockfighting ring in the capital has decided to hold a national tournament to determine who is the best kòk in Haiti.

With voting highly restricted if not outright impossible, is it any wonder the Haitian people feel such a disdain towards our government? That is what the proposed reforms seek to do away with. If enacted in full, any Haitian over the age of 18, regardless of class, creed or ethnicity will be granted the unalienable right to vote. On top of this, the reforms also call for a campaign to educate the populace of their new found rights. All that remains is government approval..."

Stubborn and stalwart as ever, Borno ignored all of these pleas as he strove to build Haiti insto a modern and strong state; ignored them all until now. As he sat at his desk in the presidential office, he heard a commotion come from outside his door. Within moments, his long-term colleagues and fellow Haitian patriots General Franck Lavaud and minister Paul Magloire swiftly entered his chambers, demanding his audience at once. Fearing both the collapse of their regime and the will of the Haitian people, the two old friends of Borno began to plead that Borno do the smart thing and announce his resignation, before their already tenuous grasp on power slipped further from their hands. The pair alternatively suggested the eventual return of elections, tampered if need be, to at least appease the people lest their combined ire cause the collapse of everything Borno has tried to build. Though stubborn, Borno was not a fool. Though resigning could tarnish his legacy forever, it could also be seen as a move of heroism and grace: a true Cinnicnatus! However, leaving the fate of the nation to elections and the uneducated masses was equally as daunting a proposition. President Borno, for once and finally, headed the pleas and warnings of his compatriots, and would internally debate this issue to its end.

Many governmental functions were absconded by the president’s office during the Occupation, and with its collapse many are clamoring for a return to previous and more agreeable arrangements. Though this would take away power and influence from Borno’s hands, it would also greatly appease and empower many across the entire political spectrum. Though this would allow us some extra breathing room for more serious reform down the line, it would also strengthen the position of the Socialists within our own regime, furthering their foul taint deeper in Haiti’s heart. However, refusing this deal would not only anger the Socialists, but would also throw the more nationalist elements of Haiti, especially within the Noiristes, into an uproar as our regime continues to bow to foregin whims instead of the will of the people. Regardless of his decision, Borno will still indirectly empower one of the groups he fears most, so who shall he take the hit for this time?."

Borno has ruled without an active and influential legislative body since he ascended to his never-ending term, and the council has limped along as lapdog, occasionally whimpering in protest before being kicked down again by Borno’s regime. While weakened, the Council still tries to personify the wider will of the Haitian people, acting as an undying roadblock that seemingly always returns to be a nuisance. To officially end this hindrance to our goals, President Borno could order Garde forces to the Council’s chambers to oversee their meetings from now on, imposing his will over its members through the Garde d'Haïti and ensuring their future compliance, while also radically angering those in its chambers, particularly the Socialist ministers led by Roumain. Alternatively, he could merely send a few officers of the peace to ensure that Council meetings run more smoothly while chastising the acting ministers to actually do their jobs, or even just not act at all. This would come off less tyrannical, drawing less ire from the Leftists. But in doing so, Borno would look weak in the eyes of the Noiristes who eye our government and its practices non-stop, ever probing for further weaknesses. We are damned if we do, and damned if we don’t, so how shall Borno respond?."

Russell Jr., this situation has also caused a great deal of instability. Democratic and socialist forces across Haiti bemoan their lack of representation, ever raising the discontent against our regime. To combat this, the legislature will be reinstated in a greatly weakened form, serving as a thin facade of legitimacy and fairness in our rule. This new legislative body would be on a short leash, easily dissolvable, and hold little real power outside, but shall hopefully dissuade the rising tide of anger against President Borno’s seemingly endless term. The final act of business is the issue of who shall be allowed within the ranks of this new legislative body and who shall be allowed to put forth new legislation to be voted on. We could ban Socialist ministers from enacting or putting forth new legislation, hamstringing their influence while drastically angering their ministers and constituents, and leaving us without their support in case the nationalists come knocking. Alternatively, we could allow Socialist to act as any other minister in the chamber may, appeasing Roumain and the Reds while deeply angering the nationalists and Noiristes under the ever more alcoholic Carl Brouard and his shining protege François Duvalier."

The two main factions are the varied Socialists in Jacques Roumain’s leftist coalition, and the remaining liberals and conservatives that form the base of Jean Price-Mars democratic coalition. If we choose to work with Roumain’s camp, we will be able to appease their ranks for now while also risking their influence which may skyrocket as more of their ministers enter our ranks. Alternatively, we could align with Price-Mars centrists. Though fewer in number, they would not carry with them the weight of the Socialist’s stigma. However, in choosing the liberals, we would no longer have the support of the Socialists, the largest faction in Haiti, who might be vital in our defense against the Noiriste militants.

haiti.536.t:0 "Controlling the Opposition"
haiti.536.d:0 "While the government of Haiti is dominated by President Louis Borno's clique, a fierce opposition force has consistently tried to block his legislation. This informal coalition of parties and ideologies, ranging from conservatives to socialists, only remains united in their disdain for Borno’s administration. To control these rabblerousers and firebrands, President Louis Borno has moved to consolidate them all under one official and state-recognized oppositional umbrella, in order to better control their opposition. Under this system, the leader of the faction, who has yet to be chosen, would serve as spokesman for the unified opposition to Borno’s administration, acting as the mouthpiece through which all criticisms and scrutiny levied against President Borno would flow through. This group would hold no executive power, in theory weakening their sway on our politics and agenda, allowing President Borno to carry out his consolidation efforts without their hindrances getting in the way. \n\nWith the coalition hammered out, all that is left to determine is who this new official coalition should nominate as Speaker of the Opposition. There are only two strong contenders in the running: Marxist author and statesman Jacques Roumain or the liberal Jean Price-Mars, famed doctor and teacher. \n\nPrice-Mars has stood as a unifying force for any liberals, moderate conservatives, and anti-socialist social democrats, who have all flocked to his side with the rise of the Noirists on the right and the Marxists on the left. Competing against him, Roumain is the founder of the newly-created Haitian Syndicalist Party, and he gained fame in his activism and resistance against the American Occupation. \n\nGoing with Price-Mars would side-step a large amount of Leftist influence that would otherwise pollute our current regime, but would leave us more exposed to the constant weathering effects of the Noirisme movement. Instead, siding with Roumain would help keep the nationalists at bay, but would also deeply increase the amount of sway the socialists hold. Which of these two titans of the political mainstream of Haiti will dictate the struggle against President Borno’s corrupt regime?"

With much of their “Haitianess” completely missing, the Garde functions as its own lobbying group for its own interests; interests that just so happen to align with our former ‘benefactors’ from Washington, D.C. Our regime has two possible stances we can take on their hopeful expansion deeper into our nation. We can either fully allow these American lapdogs into our regime as a sort of shadow ministry, working behind the scenes to ensure our dominance over radicals. Letting these slaves to foreign interests into our nation would allow us to better survey the plethora of Socialists within our regime and government, minimizing their impact on our regime. However, this would also infuriate the Noiristes under Carl Brouard and the ever-rising François Duvalier, who see the Garde for what they truly are: thugs and traitors paid for in Haitian lives and American money. How shall we proceed?"

Only together and united have we maintained this hard existence we live, and only together shall this existence continue. However, Haiti is internally divided now more than ever with the rise of the Syndicalists and Leftists under Roumain, Hudicourt, and Calixte, and with the advent of the Noirisme movement with Brouard at its head and Duvalier in his shadow. In order to sew together the divides that have shattered this union, we must reach out to one of these groups and reconcile any sort of similarities we may share. Only with the support of one of these radical groups will we ever stand even a tiny chance at maintaining our hold on power. Whoever we align with shall grow stronger and more emboldened by this official endorsement of either group, so we must be careful with which group of extremists we shall side with."

haiti.539.d:0 "With the bulk of our reforms now well underway, our regime has weathered the worst these radicals could seemingly throw at us and has lived to quash it all. As we finalize the last of our internal issues, we must begin to look outward once again. To the North across the blue pearl of a sea lies our old benefactors and overlords: the United States. Once the titan of the New World, the USA has seen better days and now lies in near ruin. Their weakness could prove to be our strength however, as ministers within our cabinet have moved to draft a new possible deal with these Yankees. Our administration still owes a great deal of money to their government through our infamous debt, and currently the Americans are desperate for capital. To act on this, these scheming ministers have planned to implement a final payment now, wiping the debt from our ledger forever. Our economy would offer a large, but partial, lump-sum payment to these desperate Yanks, and in exchange, they must not come knocking ever again looking for handouts from our people. Though this would, in theory, ensure the Americans don’t try to return to our shores in order to reclaim their lost investments, it would also deeply anger the Noiristes who vehemently despise any cooperation with these foreign dogs. Surprisingly, the Socialists have come out in support of the bill, hoping to preserve our future freedom for a mere monetary transaction now. What started out as an ordinary debate over a financial opportunity has now turned into an ideologically-fueled struggle. The result now, is anyone’s guess."

Nationalist paramilitaries and militias roam the streets and forests of our nation, fighting pockets of democratic and Socialist guerillas, as the new regime is busy at work building this new state. However, at nearly every meeting and debate these nationalists hold, one face remains ever elusive: Carl Brouard. Father of our movement and main orchestrator of the coup that brought the Noirisme movement to power, our shepherd has become ever more elusive as the reality of running a nation began to dawn on him. Falling ever deeper into his bottle, he only rarely makes public appearances at national rallies held in Port-au-Prince and other large cities, feeding off the public adoration as a temporary reprieve from his ever-deepening depressive state. Though we weep for our leader, his protege, the young François Duvalier, has been a leading figure in his stead. Though this young radical has much to learn, he has slowly begun to supplant Brouard’s role as head of these nationalists. Only time will tell how this situation unfolds, and many pray for Brouard to snap out of his state of mind and return to us as the champion of the Haitain people!"

In a desperate bid to save his countrymen from themselves, Carl Brouard, face of the Noirisme movement, has stormed the capital complex in Port-au-Prince and has taken control of the government. He and his loyal Noiristes have seized total control of the apparatus of the state and have moved to quickly return a sense of stability and cohesion to the disparate Haitian people. Though his coup was quick, it was not without blood, and many bodies of both American lapdogs and Haitian sons lie dead in the dirt. With this quick flash of violence over, Brouard has moved to solidify his supposedly temporary rule, with his disciple François Duvalier and the rest of the Noiristes at his side. What this will mean for the future of Haiti is unknown, but not many trust this aging alcoholic to be any true champion of a national revival."

As the morning rooster squawked its shrill call and the sounds of gunfire echoed throughout the city, the comatose poet lurched to life. Struggling to stand, Brouard rubbed his head as the gunfire continued to aggravate his hangover before violently hurling up whatever bile was left in his stomach in the closest wastebin and walking towards his kitchen. Opening the only cabinet with anything in it, Brouard grabbed another bottle of liquor and some bread to pad his acidic stomach for another day’s worth of drinking for his “creative process.” Walking back over to his desk, he grabbed his pack of cigarettes and lighter from the table as he waltzed by, lighting a new one and taking a swig of vodka as he retook his seat at his perch. As the burning liquid and smoke flowed into his body, life was returned to this dead-man-walking, who began to type away at his next great poetic ‘masterpiece.’ As the sounds of gunshots continued from outside as Noiriste militants continued to wage war against Syndicalist insurgents, the Father of their movement hid away in his crypt, further falling into the bottle as his protege Duvalier amasses more and more power for himself. Soon, it will be too late for anyone to stop the rise of ‘Papa Doc’."

However, at each and every major victory for the brave Noiriste militants, the Father of our nation, Carl Brouard, was nowhere to be seen. Instead, his infamous and now esteemed student François Duvalier has led the charge each and every time, proving to all true sons of Haiti that this ‘Papa Doc’ is the proven and earned leader of the Noiristes cause. As our official leader has fallen into the bottom of the bottle, drinking his way into a near-coma at every opportunity, Duvalier has instead led the people of Haiti to victory over the spectre of Syndicalism. Many have begun calling for François ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier to supplant Brouard as leader of the nation, though Duvalier has denied and decried these suggestions as traitorous to his old friend and mentor. Instead, Duvalier plans to meet with his old mentor to finally hammer out the future of their nation now that the militants have been put to rest and that the wider public now clamors for the return of free elections."

This chaotic situation is not helped by Brouard’s tight grip on power and his raging alcoholism, which has continued to grow as an obstacle to Haiti’s good governance with each drink Brouard pours. This tenuous situation is near its breaking point, with even his long-time protege Duvalier questioning Brouard’s ability to lead. His old student and friend has demanded that ‘President’ Brouard finally make a decision: either truly live up to his promise to being the saviour of Haiti by reinstating democracy, or try to maintain this juggle for total power and hope the house of cards does not collapse. If the Noriste mission is ever going to survive, stepping down may be the movement’s only hope, as a barely-functional drunkard will likely not be left to rule for much longer and his forceful removal would only further tarnish these ideals we hold so dear.

With Jacques Roumain’s horrendous actions in the recent civil strife tarnishing his legacy and the legacy of his start pupil Max Hudicourt, the only leftist party left standing is Démosthènes Calixte’s ‘La Réaction Démocratique’ which has surged in size in the wake of the Syndicalists’ collapse. Running for the center are Jean Price-Mars and his centrist coalition with Stenio Vincent and Louis Déjoie at his side. Finally, and for the first time in Haitian history, the nationalist Noiristes in the ‘Parti de l'Unité Nationale’ are also running in the race, fielding the young François Duvalier as its candidate, endorsed by Brouard himself. It has been an electrifying campaign to watch unfold, but not all has been so well followed by the public. Behind the scenes, Brouard and Duvalier have conspired to rig the vote in their favour; if their gambit pays off remains to be seen.

Luck has stricken this soon-to-be hero on this day, as most of the Noiristes movement, both military and administrative wings, are all gathered in Port-au-Prince today to celebrate their apparent victory over their enemies. However, Calixte and his men plan to ruin this meeting with a celebration of their own making. Scavenging and smuggling explosive munitions and materials from long abandoned caches left behind by the Americans, this warrior-poet plans to bomb the nationalist’s meeting, killing the bulk of their leadership and officer corps without ‘spilling a drop of innocent Haitian blood’. As a follow up to ensure their destruction, Calixte himself shall lead a charge into the ruins of Port-au-Prince's inner city atop horseback, slaughtering any Noirste dog left standing alive. Though he and his men would have to comb the wreckage and the surrounding countryside thoroughly for remaining holdouts and escapees, with this one swift blow, Calixte could save Haiti once and for all.

In their intense rivalry and clash of ideologies, further intensified over the collapse of their deep friendship and artistic cooperation, these two titans of Haitian radicalism have evolved into their extremes. While Brouard has retreated further into the depths of alcoholism, leaving more of his duties to his subordinates with every drink, Roumain has instead done the opposite of his reclusive old friend and projected his anger and pain outwards, coalescing into his now infamous bursts of near-sadistic action against his most hated foes: the Noiristes.

haiti.60.b:0 "We do not need to act yet! Watch the area closely..."
haiti.60.c:0 "This cannot stand, prepare for war!"

haiti.61.t:0 "Haiti Proposes a Deal..."
haiti.61.d:0 "The Caribbean is one of the primary regions of Entente control left in the world, having largely stayed intact in the form of the West Indies Federation. However, given the recent chaos in the Federation, and the comparative stability of our new ally Haiti, it seems that the other islands could learn something from this state. Even better, the Haitians have offered to be assimilated into the West Indies Federation, under the conditions that it be allowed to change the name of the new state as it sees fit and that the capitol be moved to Port-au-Prince. Granting this request could help stabilize the region, and allow us to focus our thin resources elsewhere, but we could also lose our grip on the area in the process. Preempting our hesitation, the Haitian delegation has already offered to further tweak the deal to further suit our interests. They have offered to grant both the Algiers Regime and our administration here in Ottawa full and sovereign control of Suriname and French Guiana, and Guyana respectively, returning these lands to their former colonial masters directly. On top of this, they have also offered to have the West Indies’ navy leave port immediately and set sail for Canadian waters in order to return to our proud command; an enticing offer given our improved state making it no longer necessary to leave the Exiled navy separated. Our options are varied, but time is ticking. What should we do?"
haiti.61.a:0 "Approve the final deal, may our lost navy return to us along with the Guiana Shield."
haiti.61.b:0 "Approve the amended deal, the Guiana Shield returns to European hands."
haiti.61.c:0 "This is all unnecessary..."`

haiti.62.t:0 "The Canadians respond!"
haiti.62.d:0 "Today, our offer to the Canadians has been answered, and the mighty northern nation has decided to accept the offer of its troops and ships along with the South American colonies in exchange for control over the Caribbean. However, this deal was accepted more easily than our diplomats originally imagined, and perhaps we could ask for more concessions. Doing so, however, could endanger the deal..."
haiti.62.a:0 "The deal is fine as is!"
haiti.62.b:0 "Explain why we need the ships here!"

haiti.63.t:0 "The Canadians respond!"
haiti.63.d:0 "To our delight, the Canadians have accepted our offer! We will guard the Caribbean for them using the old West Indies fleet while the rest of the Entente maintains control over the Guinea Shield. This is an amicable deal for all parties involved, and we look forward to a new future for the Caribbean region."
haiti.63.a:0 "Wonderful news!"

haiti.64.t:0 "The Canadians respond!"
haiti.64.d:0 "Much to our dismay, the Canadians have informed us today that they will be declining our offer. It seems they do not trust us enough to control the area, or are otherwise unwilling to give up the vital resources and geographical positions the area has to offer. This is a setback for our nation, but we will march on nonetheless!"
haiti.64.a:0 "Horrible!"

haiti.65.t:0 "The Haitians make a counter-offer"
haiti.65.d:0 "Today we have received a counter-offer from the Haitian government, stunning many of our diplomats who expected an easy deal. Perhaps they saw our willingness to rid ourselves of the West Indies, and know we desperately need a better administration in the area. Regardless, they have requested that we let them keep the ships of the old Federation, so that they will be better able to defend the area for the Entente. Should we accept this counteroffer and lose face?"
haiti.65.a:0 "If we must..."
haiti.65.b:0 "Not a chance!"

haiti.66.t:0 "A Demand for Kreyol Unity"
haiti.66.d:0 "The great Haitian state has grown from a weak and corrupt republic crumbling under American corruption into a beacon of Pan-African unity in our pearlescent Caribbean Sea. However, Haiti is not just African, but Kreyol as well! We forged this culture in the wake of European oppression, taking what good we could from their wretched traditions and fusing it with our own to create something truly unique; a culture befitting our people who were robbed from the home continent. With our regime now raising its mighty flag across this verdant archipelago, we now eye the last eden of Kreyol culture still left languishing under foregin control: Lwizyana. Our Pan-African brothers in the Black Belt Republic now own this land, and it is in our people’s best interests to demand this territory from them, for it is in Papa Doc’s best interests, and Papa Doc is the Haitian people."
haiti.66.a:0 "Send the ‘request’ at once!"

haiti.67.t:0 "A Request for Creole Unity"
haiti.67.d:0 "With our recent acquisitions in our fight for freedom, we now hold large swathes of the American South. With so much land, stability and unity have been key concerns of our administration, especially with the rise of more unruly elements in our more extraneous territories. One such problem area, growing ever more rife with civil unrest, is the former Union state of Louisiana, and a possible solution to our issues has surfaced. A strange and stern request from Haitian president François ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier, noted Pan-African nationalist autocrat, has arrived on our desk. In a strongly worded ‘request’ letter bordering on a demand, this ‘Papa Doc’ has asked for our regime to transfer administrative rights and control of Louisiana in the name of “Pan-African cooperation and Creole unity” in the words of the Haitian dictator. We could fulfil this request, cementing cooperation between the two prominent majority-Black states in the New World, and relieving ourselves of the headache of Cajun rebels and Longist remnants. However, this would also deeply offend many in our young nation, especially the more nationalist elements. How shall we respond?"
haiti.67.a:0 "Acquiesce Papa Doc’s request in the name of unity and cooperation between our two great states."
haiti.67.b:0 "Refuse this madman at once!"

haiti.68.t:0 "The [BBR.GetName] Declines Our Offer!"
haiti.68.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, the [BBR.GetName] has declined our request for Louisiana. It is true that this was a longshot offer, but we were hoping that they would be more willing to work together..."
haiti.68.a:0 "A shame!"

haiti.69.t:0 "A Question on Voting Rights"
haiti.69.d:0 "As it currently stands, only men are eligible to vote within the nation of Haiti in national elections. However, with our pushes to establish ‘real’ democracy in Haiti, many have decried the lack of voting rights for women to be hilariously hypocritical. Though many in our nation detest this idea, particularly many within the Noiristes and other traditionalist groups throughout the nation, giving women the ability to vote now would greatly legitimize our democratization campaign in the eyes of the masses, allowing our first real elections since the rise of President Borno to truly represent the will of all voting adults in Haiti. The final vote on this issue is upon us as our ministers meet in this historic session while the nation waits eagerly to see the final decision. The final votes are being tallied and it seems..."
haiti.69.a:0 "...women’s suffrage has finally come to Haitian shores as women are given the right to vote."
haiti.69.b:0 "...women of Haiti will have to wait, as the council settles on a resounding no."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_JACQUES_ROMAIN_DESC:0 "Jacques Roumain prolific poet, once a close associate of both liberal and Noiriste writers alike, together with a close-knit group of like minded ideologes, founded the Haitian Syndicalist Party and began the formalisation of the fragmented Haitian left. While he would alienate his liberal and Noiriste once-allies in the process, the movement he would create propelled him to the forefront of opposition to the authoritarian regime of Louis Borno."
POLITICS_GEORGES_RIGAUD_DESC:0 "A leader of protests against the discriminatory policies the United States imposed upon Haitian education system, Rigaud was beaten to inch of his life at the hands of American Marines as a young student in Port-Au-Prince. Soon thereafter, as a leader of the burgeoning labor movement, while others within the Haitian left would embrace fully European ideas of socialism, Rigaud would instead attempt to mold syndicalist ideas to fit the unique history and culture of Haiti."
POLITICS_LOUIS_BORNO_DESC:0 "In 1922, Louis Borno was elected in a seeming act of defiance by the Council of State against the occupying Americans. Borno, however, would prove entirely willing to not only cooperate with the United States, but work hand in hand to ensure their mutual success. During the occupation, Borno, with the approval of Marine General John Russell and the United States, managed to eliminate Haiti's crippling debts, complete unprecedented infrastructure projects, and stabilise the country's political turmoil. With the end of the occupation amidst renewed unrest, Borno was allowed to retain the presidency.\nDeeply Catholic and despite his willingness to work with the United States, Borno's authoritarian reign has also seen a good deal of social change, especially regarding the status of Kreyol. As he looks to the future, the aging President Borno is faced with threats to his rule both from within Haiti and without, and his successes and failures alike will undoubtedly shape Haiti's future political landscape for years to come."
POLITICS_JOHN_RUSSELL_DESC:0 "General John Russell's long tenure as American Marine Commissioner for Haiti suffered only a minor hiccup with the withdrawal of American Marines from the country, still keeping a close eye on the affairs of Haiti's civilian government. While sympathetic to the Haitian people and holding surprisingly tolerant racial views, Russell is loyal only to the United States."

### Ideas ###
HAI_education_deficit:0 "Education Deficit"
HAI_education_deficit_desc:0 "A severe lack of education is one of, if not the, biggest problems Haiti faces today. Our lack of education doesn’t just afflict higher learning or grade schooling; it has affected every aspect of our nation’s combined intellect so thoroughly that even our farmers grow their crops through inefficient or otherwise outdated means. This extreme educational deficiency must be fixed, as Haiti cannot survive if its population remains as some of the least educated people in the world. No matter our direction, education is a top priority."

HAI_garde_influence:0 "Influence of the Garde"
HAI_garde_influence_desc:0 "The Garde d'Haïti stands as the only official military apparatus available to our state. Formed with American supervision and with American equipment, it is no wonder who they truly serve. White and Mixed officers command squads of native soldiers as they terrorize and discriminate against the native Haitian people. Formed in a failed attempt to create an apolitical armed force for our nation, the Garde frequently forces its way into national politics through lobbying or corruption. In its current state, the Garde d'Haïti will only ever serve their benefactors, leaving our government without a reliable armed forces."

### Events ###
haiti.1.t:0 "The American Commission Pulls Out!"
haiti.1.d:0 "For twenty long and onerous years, our so-called ‘benefactors’ from the United States pressed their boot into the people of our island nation, their black mark leaving a stain on the pristinely white beaches we call home. Under their watch, Haiti was both uplifted and downtrodden as the Americans and their puppet in President Louis Borno raped our nation’s land and ransacked our economy for their own gain, all under the false and dangerous pretense of ‘nation building’ and ‘preserving the peace.’ As the new year dawns, we find ourselves staring into a Spring in which we are not on Washington’s leash for the first time in two decades, and with our new freedom comes the potential for both great successes and terrible failures. To begin our new journey, the most pressing issues must be handled first. Chief among these new concerns would be what to do with the remnants of the American Commission, and the numerous inquiries into our State that they were administering before their hasty departure in the wake of Black Monday. Our former overlords were in the middle of conducting numerous Commissionary investigations, enacted by now infamous President Herbert Hoover, into our state’s handling of issues in agriculture, political freedoms, economic mobility, and the biggest plague of them all, our rampantly corrupt and grossly inefficient education system. While the original investigators are all long gone, their work and findings remain here, still unfinished, offering an opportunity to pick up from where they left off so that we ourselves may probe into Haiti’s myriad of issues. These half-finished reports are not all the Yankees left us however, with much of the infrastructure, administrative systems, and other bureaucratic amenities of the Commission and the occupying force being left standing and still in well-working and usable condition. These bounties have left our administration with a choice: either mothball these facilities and unfinished inquiries, relegating them to be demolished or forgotten, or pay the steep price in upkeep in order to finish these probes and renovate their facilities for our own uses."
haiti.1.a:0 "We do not need these remnants of our oppressors. Demolish the remaining facilities and scrap the investigations."
haiti.1.b:0 "They have just abandoned a treasure trove of useful information and equipment for our state. How could we pass this opportunity up?"

haiti.2.t:0 "A New Normal"
haiti.2.d.nofacilities:0 "With our recent reforms to our education system going smoothly, particularly in regards to our agricultural curriculum thanks to the early successes of SNPAER, and the recent demolition of the last remaining marks of the American Occupation, Haiti has ushered in a new era of normalcy and calm. Throwing off the yoke of our former imperialist oppressors once and for all, the proud Haitian republic can now march unhindered in its quest to drag our island home into the modern age. With nationalist groups appeased over our recent anti-American actions and the farmers appeased with their new reforms, it seems a brief atmosphere of peace has been achieved, with our administration now moving to ensure this placid state lasts as the nation carries on with its agenda."
haiti.2.d.facilities:0 "With our recent reforms to our education system going smoothly, particularly in regards to our agricultural curriculum thanks to the early successes of SNPAER, and with the last of the former-American facilities being full renovated, it seems our proud republic has managed to achieve a new sense of normalcy in defiance to our usually turbid history. As we continue the probes into our problems the Yankees commissioned and integrate the newly-redone infrastructure directly into the state apparatus, we shall be able to continue where they left off and further push Haiti into the 20th century. Though our confiscation of these old American assets has greatly disturbed both the nationalist and socialist radicals that chomp at the bit for their chance to strike, a placid peace has still been ushered in. Now it is up to the current regime to maintain this air of calm, lest Haiti collapse back into the fires of abnormality yet again."
haiti.2.a:0 "Though some still doubt our work, we shall march defiantly into a normal future."
haiti.2.b:0 "With normalcy achieved, the great Haitian state can look towards its future without dread."

haiti.3.t:0 "Integrating the Jesuit Schools"
haiti.3.d:0 "As our government goes about the process of reforming Haiti's neigh nonexistent Education system, the inescapable question of what to do with the various Jesuit schools that dot the Haitian landscape has finally come into full focus. These schools, run by the Society of Jesus, are one of the few places a Haitian can get a quality education, however they also taint the minds of our youth with Roman Catholicism. While the majority of the population is Catholic, the question for what to do with the schools is a highly contested issue within the halls of power. Many with Catholic leanings wish for us to begin publicly funding the Jesuit schools. They argue that with public funding, not only will the good work they do spread, but core Haitian values that spring from Catholicism will spread along with good education. Secularists and many more left leaning members of our government argue for the nationalization of the schools, perhaps maintaining the same staff but throwing out any mention of Catholicism or religion outside of historical and cultural references. A third option, supported by hardly anyone is too simply ignore the Jesuit schools, and focus on building a good public education system, saving time and money in the process."
haiti.3.a:0 "The conservatives are right, the Jesuit must be state sponsored!"
haiti.3.b:0 "The leftists are right, only a secular school system is fit for our free Haiti."
haiti.3.c:0 "The Jesuit schools are a waste of our time! We need to focus on building up our own schools!"

haiti.52.t:0 "Noiriste Outrage"
haiti.52.d:0 "Our decision to back down in the face of Dominican brutality has angered many. As a result, voices within the identitarian 'Noiriste' movement have grown in strength, with many ordinary citizens embracing their destructive ideology."
haiti.52.a:0 "Worrying."

haiti.53.t:0 "Noiriste Surge"
haiti.53.d:0 "The Noiriste movement continues to grow in popular support and our efforts to eliminate the movement's leaders have so-far failed. Something has to give."
haiti.53.a:0 "This Must Be Stopped."

haiti.54.t:0 "Noiriste Coup"
haiti.54.d:0 "While the Garde has for so long attempted to root out the Noiristes, it seems they have now revealed themselves - and with guns in their hands at that. Port-Au-Prince has erupted into street battles between Noiriste and the Garde, with the Noiristes slowly working their way towards the city centre and our government."
haiti.54.a:0 "The Coup Succeeds."
haiti.54.b:0 "The Coup Fails."

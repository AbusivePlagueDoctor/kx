### Leaders ###
POLITICS_JACQUES_ROMAIN_DESC:0 "Jacques Roumain prolific poet, once a close associate of both liberal and Noiriste writers alike, together with a close-knit group of like minded ideologes, founded the Haitian Syndicalist Party and began the formalisation of the fragmented Haitian left. While he would alienate his liberal and Noiriste once-allies in the process, the movement he would create propelled him to the forefront of opposition to the authoritarian regime of Louis Borno."
POLITICS_GEORGES_RIGAUD_DESC:0 "A leader of protests against the discriminatory policies the United States imposed upon Haitian education system, Rigaud was beaten to inch of his life at the hands of American Marines as a young student in Port-Au-Prince. Soon thereafter, as a leader of the burgeoning labor movement, while others within the Haitian left would embrace fully European ideas of socialism, Rigaud would instead attempt to mold syndicalist ideas to fit the unique history and culture of Haiti."
POLITICS_LOUIS_BORNO_DESC:0 "In 1922, Louis Borno was elected in a seeming act of defiance by the Council of State against the occupying Americans. Borno, however, would prove entirely willing to not only cooperate with the United States, but work hand in hand to ensure their mutual success. During the occupation, Borno, with the approval of Marine General John Russell and the United States, managed to eliminate Haiti's crippling debts, complete unprecedented infrastructure projects, and stabilise the country's political turmoil. With the end of the occupation amidst renewed unrest, Borno was allowed to retain the presidency.\nDeeply Catholic and despite his willingness to work with the United States, Borno's authoritarian reign has also seen a good deal of social change, especially regarding the status of Kreyol. As he looks to the future, the aging President Borno is faced with threats to his rule both from within Haiti and without, and his successes and failures alike will undoubtedly shape Haiti's future political landscape for years to come."
POLITICS_JOHN_RUSSELL_DESC:0 "General John Russell's long tenure as American Marine Commissioner for Haiti suffered only a minor hiccup with the withdrawal of American Marines from the country, still keeping a close eye on the affairs of Haiti's civilian government. While sympathetic to the Haitian people and holding surprisingly tolerant racial views, Russell is loyal only to the United States."

Our lack of education doesn’t just afflict higher learning or grade schooling; it has affected every aspect of our nation’s combined intellect so thoroughly that even our farmers grow their crops through inefficient or otherwise outdated means.

haiti.1.t:0 "The American Commission Pulls Out!"
haiti.1.d:0 "For twenty long and onerous years, our so-called ‘benefactors’ from the United States pressed their boot into the people of our island nation, their black mark leaving a stain on the pristinely white beaches we call home. Under their watch, Haiti was both uplifted and downtrodden as the Americans and their puppet in President Louis Borno raped our nation’s land and ransacked our economy for their own gain, all under the false and dangerous pretense of ‘nation building’ and ‘preserving the peace.’ As the new year dawns, we find ourselves staring into a Spring in which we are not on Washington’s leash for the first time in two decades, and with our new freedom comes the potential for both great successes and terrible failures. To begin our new journey, the most pressing issues must be handled first. Chief among these new concerns would be what to do with the remnants of the American Commission, and the numerous inquiries into our State that they were administering before their hasty departure in the wake of Black Monday. Our former overlords were in the middle of conducting numerous Commissionary investigations, enacted by now infamous President Herbert Hoover, into our state’s handling of issues in agriculture, political freedoms, economic mobility, and the biggest plague of them all, our rampantly corrupt and grossly inefficient education system. While the original investigators are all long gone, their work and findings remain here, still unfinished, offering an opportunity to pick up from where they left off so that we ourselves may probe into Haiti’s myriad of issues. These half-finished reports are not all the Yankees left us however, with much of the infrastructure, administrative systems, and other bureaucratic amenities of the Commission and the occupying force being left standing and still in well-working and usable condition. These bounties have left our administration with a choice: either mothball these facilities and unfinished inquiries, relegating them to be demolished or forgotten, or pay the steep price in upkeep in order to finish these probes and renovate their facilities for our own uses."
haiti.1.a:0 "We do not need these remnants of our oppressors. Demolish the remaining facilities and scrap the investigations."
haiti.1.b:0 "They have just abandoned a treasure trove of useful information and equipment for our state. How could we pass this opportunity up?"

haiti.2.t:0 "A New Normal"
haiti.2.d.nofacilities:0 "With our recent reforms to our education system going smoothly, particularly in regards to our agricultural curriculum thanks to the early successes of SNPAER, and the recent demolition of the last remaining marks of the American Occupation, Haiti has ushered in a new era of normalcy and calm. Throwing off the yoke of our former imperialist oppressors once and for all, the proud Haitian republic can now march unhindered in its quest to drag our island home into the modern age. With nationalist groups appeased over our recent anti-American actions and the farmers appeased with their new reforms, it seems a brief atmosphere of peace has been achieved, with our administration now moving to ensure this placid state lasts as the nation carries on with its agenda."
haiti.2.d.facilities:0 "With our recent reforms to our education system going smoothly, particularly in regards to our agricultural curriculum thanks to the early successes of SNPAER, and with the last of the former-American facilities being full renovated, it seems our proud republic has managed to achieve a new sense of normalcy in defiance to our usually turbid history. As we continue the probes into our problems the Yankees commissioned and integrate the newly-redone infrastructure directly into the state apparatus, we shall be able to continue where they left off and further push Haiti into the 20th century. Though our confiscation of these old American assets has greatly disturbed both the nationalist and socialist radicals that chomp at the bit for their chance to strike, a placid peace has still been ushered in. Now it is up to the current regime to maintain this air of calm, lest Haiti collapse back into the fires of abnormality yet again."
haiti.2.a:0 "Though some still doubt our work, we shall march defiantly into a normal future."
haiti.2.b:0 "With normalcy achieved, the great Haitian state can look towards its future without dread."

haiti.3.t:0 "Integrating the Jesuit Schools"
haiti.3.d:0 "As our government goes about the process of reforming Haiti's neigh nonexistent Education system, the inescapable question of what to do with the various Jesuit schools that dot the Haitian landscape has finally come into full focus. These schools, run by the Society of Jesus, are one of the few places a Haitian can get a quality education, however they also taint the minds of our youth with Roman Catholicism. While the majority of the population is Catholic, the question for what to do with the schools is a highly contested issue within the halls of power. Many with Catholic leanings wish for us to begin publicly funding the Jesuit schools. They argue that with public funding, not only will the good work they do spread, but core Haitian values that spring from Catholicism will spread along with good education. Secularists and many more left leaning members of our government argue for the nationalization of the schools, perhaps maintaining the same staff but throwing out any mention of Catholicism or religion outside of historical and cultural references. A third option, supported by hardly anyone is too simply ignore the Jesuit schools, and focus on building a good public education system, saving time and money in the process."
haiti.3.a:0 "The conservatives are right, the Jesuit must be state sponsored!"
haiti.3.b:0 "The leftists are right, only a secular school system is fit for our free Haiti."
haiti.3.c:0 "The Jesuit schools are a waste of our time! We need to focus on building up our own schools!"

haiti.4.t:0 "An Unshakeable System"
haiti.4.d:0 "As the sun sets on the era of the American Occupation, a new dawn rises for our state. Dissidents have been routed, the legislature and chamber have been thoroughly shackled, and Haiti stands proud and united for the first time in decades. President Borno’s recent reforms have helped him consolidate his rule while also forging a shared sense of national unity like how a blacksmith would temper fine steel. After reigning for over ten years, President Borno finally rules solidly and firmly, and finally without parroting the orders of a foreigner. Haiti shall march into its new future now unhindered by both detractors and Yankees. Though the current Speaker of the Opposition keeps amassing more influence, and with socialist and nationalist numbers increasing by the day, our stalwart state will not bow in the face of these fools. Haiti marches on!"
haiti.4.a:0 "A foundation of concrete and steel has been forged. Our regime will not falter."

haiti.5.t:0 "A Stable System"
haiti.5.d:0 "As we emerge from the dark age that was the American Occupation, we look back at how far Haiti has come in such a short time. As 1936 dawned, we had just shed the shackles of American oppression as the Haitian people withered under a decrepit and decaying authoritarian presidency. With President Borno’s recent shifts towards democratic ideals however, this withering has begun to be repaired as the fresh growth of republicanism has taken root on our island once more. With our initial reforms going splendidly, Haiti’s government hasn't been this pure and virtuous in decades, and we Haitains look wondrously towards our new destiny: one illuminated by the glow of democracy. The last of the preparations must be planned and finalized, but it won’t be long until fair and free elections finally return to our island paradise."
haiti.5.a:0 "The Haitian Spring has bloomed. True democracy is within arm’s reach."

haiti.6.t:0 "A Face for the Haitian Centre"
haiti.6.d:0 "With the Haitian Republic well back on track towards normal democratic functions and the bulk of our past issues that plagued the legitimacy of our regime now solved, free and fair elections are once again slated to be held. As the planned date draws nearer, the liberal-conservative coalition that serves as the basis of the Liberal Party must now choose an official candidate to field. This candidate will become the face of our varied coalition for years to come, and as such the choice must be made with some care and fairness. As such, an internal election shall be held within our party to determine who shall lead our party in the race for the presidency of Haiti."
haiti.6.a:0 "Jean Price-Mars, liberal titan and father of Haitian Pan-Africanism."
haiti.6.b:0 "Louis Déjoie, prominent industrialist and sugar magnate."

haiti.7.t:0 "Free Elections Return to Haiti"
haiti.7.ds:0 "For the first time in over two decades, free and fair elections are once again being held in the Haitian Republic. Finally, our nation’s democratic-sounding name shall be a lie no longer as true power is vested within the people once more. With all parties being declared legal before the campaigning began, it is expected for the dominated socialist coalition to win out, but the Social Democrats or Liberals could easily act on disunity amongst the far-left in order to seize the win. It is anyone’s race, and as the last of the votes are counted, it seems..."

Finally, our nation’s democratic-sounding name shall be a lie no longer as true power is vested within the people once more.

With the last of the votes coming in, the race is about to be called, and it seems that..."
haiti.7.a:0 "The Syndicalist party, a large coalition of leftist extremists, has won the day."
haiti.7.b:0 "The Social Democratic party wins, shifting us towards a pink creole democracy."
haiti.7.c:0 "The Liberal Coalition wins out, cementing our capitalist roots."

haiti.8.t:0 "Legalize Political Parties"
haiti.8.d:0 "For years, political parties have been officially banned in Haitian politics, with their members instead organizing into groups that operate outside the official political scene. With this arrangement, these parties actively disseminate their ideals and build their strength, but are unable to actually participate in any governmental capacity. This must be rectified if we are to build a functioning democracy. We have offered amnesty to their members and declared all previously banned parties to now be legal, from the nationalist Noirists inspired by pan-Africanism and the Negritude movement to the Marxist syndicalists and other various leftist groups. Shockingly however, the Noirists have refused our invitation, instead deciding to continue to work outside the official system. The rest of the parties, from socialists to conservatives, have banded together into a semi-official coalition, echoing their previous cooperation as independent organizations. With this step, Haiti inches closer to democracy."
haiti.8.a:0 "Political freedom and expression returns to Haiti."

haiti.9.t:0 "Eliminate Dissent"
haiti.9.d:0 "Our current president’s regime has stood in place for over a decade now, and has only managed to survive by the skin of its teeth, even with the ‘support’ of the Americans. With them gone, we can not afford divisions to be sewn throughout our ranks, for our regime is far too vulnerable and fragile to take much more abuse. From behind our temporary facade of strength, we shall strike at the firebrands and naysayers that have derided and ridiculed the Borno regime for years. Newspapers and radio stations will be censored, offices and safe-houses ransacked, and known or strongly suspected traitors will be arrested en masse; there will be no respite. Each and every one of these enemies of the state shall rot in our nation's jail cells or be forced to toil in our many fields as penance for their action, and if any refuse to come peacefully, they will only be met with a swift and true justice. We will not tolerate these detractors and naysayers any more."
haiti.9.a:0 "Open enemies of the state will no longer run free, spewing their vitriolic lies about our great administration."

haiti.10.t:0 "Legislative Guidance"
haiti.10.d:0 "President Louis Borno has ruled over Haiti without the hindrance of an active legislature since he ascended to his current position in 1922. Though this has allowed him to rule relatively unhindered, as long as he obeyed the rare command from his American master John H. Russell Jr., this situation has also caused a great deal of instability. Democratic and socialist forces across Haiti bemoan their lack of representation, ever raising the discontent against our regime. To combat this, the legislature will be reinstated in a greatly weakened form, serving as a thin facade of legitimacy and fairness in our rule. This new legislative body would be on a short leash, easily dissolvable, and hold little real power outside, but shall hopefully dissuade the rising tide of anger against President Borno’s seemingly endless term."
haiti.10.a:0 "This should be more than enough to appease the masses for now"

haiti.11.t:0 "The Status of the Legislature"
haiti.11.d:0 "Just weeks ago, the American Occupation that has strangled our nation for twenty years collapsed seemingly overnight as the Americans reeled in the face of Black Monday and fled home to cut spending. With our puppet-masters gone, President Borno remains as the leader of the republic, his strings finally cut from his masters. With scores of angry socialists, nationalists, and republicans decrying our administration each day, and with more and more of our general populace growing disillusioned with our rule, Haiti and its legislature stand at a crossroads. Free to govern as we see fit, and with the legislature gaining powers once more for the first time in two decades, a choice must be made: to double-down on our authoritarian ways by dissolving the chamber while also moving to uplift the Haitian people, or we could drift towards democratic principles once more, slowly transitioning the state towards a democratic future. While maintaining our grip and sidelining the legislature would appease many in the newly popular Noirist and Negritude movements, as well as the more conservative republicans remaining in the dying conservative parties, it would also inevitably garner even more hate from the various socialist groups that have exploded in popularity since the arrival of the Yankees. The alternative is no more universally popular, and the drift to democracy and reformation of the council will almost-assuredly anger these traditionalist and nationalist groups as the only competitive parties all having at least a slight-leftist slant. No matter where we take the legislature, we will be walking on glass until our many problems are resolved...or until we collapse underneath them."
haiti.11.a:0 "We shall move towards a democratic and free future! Re-empower the legislature and reform the council."
haiti.11.b:0 "We will continue down our current path and dissolve the chamber to prevent any roadblocks to our rule."

haiti.12.t:0 "Koffeemark"
haiti.12.d:0 "In an attempt to attract the attention of German Investors, the government of [HAI.GetLeader] has begun a new program entitled the "Koffeemark Project." The program is a simple one really, but how it will be carried out is what should be most attractive. In essence all the project is is a dramatic reduction in tariffs and taxes and the like get new investors for our coffee industry. However, in order to get the attention of German investors, the government is creating a series of "Koffeemark Zones" in which the German Mark is the accepted currency and German the only language spoken. While this move is... strange, to say the least, [HAI.GetLeader] hopes it will peak enough attention to get the Kaiserreich's investors interested in the virgin Haitian economy."
haiti.12.a:0 "A strange move indeed."

haiti.13.t:0 "A Truly Haitian HASCO"
haiti.13.d:0 "Among the various relics of the American Occupation stands HASCO, or the Haitian American Sugar Company, a monolith embodying the foreign influence that has perverted the sugarcane industry on Hispaniola for centuries. As we move to continue clearing the Black Mark the Occupation left on our nation, we shall reform and rebrand HASCO to truly work for Haitian interests alone. The conglomerate has been renamed to HSCO, shedding the influence of the Yankees in our agricultural pursuits. The state shall take over general operations, with parts of it being sold off and privatized piece by piece to native Haitians as the opportunities present themselves. The sugar industry in Haiti can now breath free and expand at its own pace, finally free from the shackles of foreign entanglements."
haiti.13.a:0 "The new and improved HSCO shall shed the shell of its American past and work solely for Haitians from now on."

haiti.14.t:0 "Millionaires’ Row"
haiti.14.d:0 "In addition to their occupation forces, the Americans also brought with them Yankee citizens seeking to use our island for their own various ends. The richest of these foreigners settled down in a ritzy neighborhood of high-class housing and apartments in Port-au-Prince, gaining the nickname of ‘Millionaires’ Row’ over time due to the flamboyantly wealthy residents it lured in. Not only did they bring with them their exorbitant fortunes, but also their racial intolerance, instituting a form of segregation in the areas they inhabited and enforced by both corrupt police and American marines. \n\nWith their benefactors and protectors now gone, those who have stayed instead of fleeing with the occupational forces are desperate for an olive branch. We will approach these elites and garner their support, both financial and political, in order to allow these fools to pay back to the nation that has harbored them for so long. However, we must be careful as to not let these benefactors become our next overlords, so they will be kept on a short leash."
haiti.14.a:0 "Yesterday’s oppressor, Today’s lapdog."

haiti.15.t:0 "Achieving Financial Independence"
haiti.15.d:0 "With every foreign benefactor or ‘civilization builder’ that arrives on our shores to do business in our lands, the Haitian people’s pride, independence, and economy are all marked with yet another black stain, each stain further relegating us to be the mere economic playground of other world powers. This ends now! Under a slew of new financial reforms, from new tariffs and trade policies to new foreign-owned property laws and other new policies, all backdoors exploited by these vultures will be sealed, and with it, the gates to our financial independence shall open. Haiti will stand as a mere waystation in the middle of the Caribbean no longer; a new age of economic freedom will be ushered in, and our island nation will serve as a beacon to this new age. The Hatian economy will work for Haitians now, filling our pockets instead of the pockets of greasy fat cats overseas."
haiti.15.a:0 "We will break the tethers that bind us and burst free into the wider world market."

haiti.16.t:0 "Refinancing the Debt"
haiti.16.d:0 "Haiti holds the dubious honor of usually being the poorest nation in North America. Even with Borno’s mildly successful economic reforms and the ‘help’ of the Americans, our island nation still exists in utter squalor, with only the few privileged elites able to rise from the muck that ensnares our nation’s economy. Part of this poverty comes from our immense debt. First tallying up after our revolution against France, our debt has only continued to rise as more ‘benefactors’ lent us money or aid. Though much of the debt to France has been paid off in the many decades since our initial revolution from imperialism, we still owe large sums of money to the United States from the Occupation and, to a lesser extent, to the Kaiserreich, particularly over payments owed to German coffee barons and HAPAG shipping captains. Our administration has decided to reach out to our debtors and refinance our debt to lower our payments and interest rates to more favorable levels. This would allow our regime to reassess and reorganize our incredibly chaotic economic position under a less dire and oppressive situation."
haiti.16.a:0 "We shall reach out to our generous lenders and ask for a fairer deal."

haiti.1600.t:0 "Haiti Seeks Debt Refinancing"
haiti.1600.d:0 "As the ravages of Black Monday and the Great Depression wreak havoc on our own economy and the economies of our neighbors, many pleas for financial aid have reached our shores. Among the more interesting proposals has come in from Port-au-Prince, where the reigning Borno administration has ruled Haiti for decades with American backing. They have asked if we would be willing to sit down and renegotiate their long standing debt to our government, seeking more agreeable terms and less extreme interest rates as they seek to further rebuild their fledgling economy. Though we do not officially reign in Haiti anymore, with the Occupation ending in 1935, their financial strength could still prove beneficial to our state and our lingering business and military interests still left on Hispaniola. How shall we respond?"
haiti.1600.a:0 "We must lift these sanctions if Haiti is ever to truly thrive."
haiti.1600.b:0 "Why should we care about the plight of some Haitians? Deny their request!"

haiti.1601.t:0 "Our 'Benefactor' Responds"
haiti.1601.d:0 "Our "benefactors" in Washington have responded to our refinancing request with a begrudging yes. They have agreed to sit down and hammer out more agreeable terms with our administration. With their help, Haiti’s economy may burst forth into prosperity as the crushing weight of our debt no longer strangles the lifeblood of our finances. Though we still have much to repay, the terms and interest rates are far more realistic for our meager but ambitious economy to manage."
haiti.1601.a:0 "Fantastic! Our economy breathes easy with this burden lessened."

haiti.1602.t:0 "Our 'Benefactor' Responds"
haiti.1602.d:0 "Our "benefactors" in Washington have responded to our refinancing request with a crushing and resounding no. With their denial on our request to negotiate, the oppressive and suffocative debt shall continue to strangle our nation’s economy. Though this won’t be a fatal blow to our aspirations, the economic impact it will have on our finances and industry will be noticeable and crippling for some time."
haiti.1602.a:0 "Damn these economic imperialists! We must find another way out of our financial pit."

haiti.17.t:0 "Supporting the Private Banking Sector"
haiti.17.d:0 "Since the American Occupation and the rise of the Borno regime, much of the capital in Haiti has been centralized into the hands of the BRH, or Banque de la République d'Haïti, which stands as the sole national and Hatian-run bank of our nation. The only other banks that have been allowed to continue operating have been banks run on foregin capital from America, Germany, and France. To restore some good faith to our regime in the public’s eyes while also allowing for economic growth, we should begin to work more openly with these private banks. Not only would it allow more capital to flow into our economy while also appeasing the people, but it would also relieve much of the strain and financial burden of running the state off of our shoulders, reducing our spending dramatically. With the private banks working in unison with the BRH, Haiti’s financial future inches closer to prosperity."
haiti.17.a:0 "The BRH does not need to be the sole Haitian-run bank on the island any longer."

haiti.18.t:0 "Negotiate with HAPAG"
haiti.18.d:0 "The Hamburg Amerikanische Packetfahrt Actien-Gesellschaft, or as it's more commonly referred to as HAPAG, is the dominant player in international and regional shipping in the waters that surround our islands. Making our home sea their ‘Caribbean Lake’, the once successful but comparatively small company has evolved into a monolithic monopoly since their patron nation emerged victorious from the Weltkrieg. Topping the global hierarchy as one of the largest shipping companies on Earth, HAPAG’s dominance in Haiti has never been stronger, with their influence and hold over our economy continuing to grow with each successful route or order they fulfill. Too large and well-backed for us to dare tackle head on, we must go with a more diplomatic approach in order to achieve our goals. We will meet with HAPAG’s chief executives in the region and work out a deal that suits both parties. We will need at least access to their ports, dockyards, and other naval infrastructure if we are ever going to achieve any semblance of self-sufficiency and economic growth in this nation."
haiti.18.a:0 "We must strike a deal with these foreigners in order to secure the economic future of our republic."

haiti.19.t:0 "Dealing with Disloyal Appointees"
haiti.19.d:0 "As we begin to implement our various economic reforms, it is becoming increasing clear that the already passed reforms are being stonewalled. While on paper we may have begun to change and charge our economy, on the ground however, nothing is different. After an investigation by the relevant authorities, it has come to light that a series of bureaucratic officials in everything from the military to the education department are doing everything in their power to overturn our reforms. While not organized, and divided heavily by ideology (mostly radicals, even a handful of American holdouts) they are still a massive threat to any progress. To deal with this, [HAI.GetLeader] has authorized a great purge to deal with these trouble makers. The form of the purge is to be..."

haiti.19.b:0 "...a series of layoffs, with a few prison sentences to let the people know we mean business"

haiti.20.t:0 "Wresting Control of the Sugar Industry"
haiti.20.d:0 "With our decision to finally deal with the Imperialist who for so long have held Haiti under their iron grasp, it has been decided by the Revolutionary Government that one of our first targets shall be the sugar industry. From the very foundation our nation, the Haitian sugar industry has been owned by foreign imperialists, European fat cats who sit their mansions, sipping tea sweetened by the fruit of the sweat of the worker. No longer shall this continue! Effective immediately, all sugar plantations are to be nationalized and returned to their rightful owners! No longer will the White Man oppress our people, no longer will the fat cats reap what they did not sow. Soon, it shall be the workers sipping tea sweetened his own fruits! As for the landowners themselves, they shall revive their just reward; They shall work until they drop dead, working the mines, the fields, growing the sugar they used without giving a thought to the ones who grew it for them."
haiti.20.a:0 "He who controls the sugar..."

haiti.21.t:0 "Smash the Coalition"
haiti.21.d:0 "With all, or most, political parties now being free to participate in elections and the flowers of free democracy blossoming once again on our island home, our regime has now moved to completely dismantle the current and long-standing coalition of leftist, liberal, and even some of the few remaining and quickly dying conservative parties that banded together in the face of American intervention and Haiti’s slide into soft authoritarianism. With the coalition demolished, the constituent parties, ranging from Maximist and Sorelian zealots to moderate liberals and even the rarer conservatives who have not yet left their parties for the ever-growing nationalist organizations, may now pursue their own individual political agendas. Though only a handful of parties actually stand any chance of winning in a real election cycle, this air of political freedom is just another step on the road to a stable and free system."
haiti.21.a:0 "From the ashes of the coalition, true political freedom and diversity can flourish in Haiti."

haiti.22.t:0 "Cultural Industry"
haiti.22.d:0 "Though we must burst forth into an industrialized and modern future, we must never forget our heritage. The Haitian identity and culture goes back to when the first white-sailed ships first arrived on this island and even sooner in both our native roots here and our African blood from the home continent. Even as we erect great cities and factories and fill the air with black smoke, or as we plow these fields efficiently and for sustenance as opposed to greed, we must never stray from the identity we have fostered and built for generations. It will be woven into our architecture, our policy, our communes. It will echo in every factory and every mine. It will be sung about in hymns as our people work the fields they now all own. Our tradition must never be forgotten; we are creole, we are African, we are indigenous, we are Haitian."
haiti.22.a:0 "Our culture is our identity, it will be the backbone of our new economy."

haiti.23.t:0 "Smashing the Coffee Barons"
haiti.23.d:0 "Our incredibly fertile island is host to numerous plantations and large fields of cash crops that stretch across the landscape, but yet for all the land they use and for all the profits they make, very little if any ever reaches the Haitian people. This practice has gone on for centuries, whether the oppressor be Spanish, French, or American, with none of the benefits going into the hands of the Haitians themselves except for our brief respite of freedom thanks to Toussaint L’Ouverture and his heroics. Currently, the main offenders are rich Haitians and the remaining American and European landowners foolish enough to stay within our borders, and at the top of their hierarchy are the Coffee Barons. Coffee production, along with sugarcane, sisal, and cotton, make up the bulk of all crops grown in Haiti, leading to starvation being an ever present risk for many despite the sheer volume of land devoted to growing crops. To cut the head off this snake, as it were, our new administration, championing the will of the Haitian people, shall strike at these Coffee Barons who sit at the top of the pile and remove them from the equation of our issues. With them deposed and their lands seized by the government for nationalization and their assets redistributed to the people and into government funds, we shall take back centuries of reparations in a single stroke."
haiti.23.a:0 "The era of the Coffee Barons and their exploitation is at an end."

haiti.24.t:0 "Break the Imperialist Stranglehold"
haiti.24.d:0 "With the stunning victory of leftist politics liberating the workers and farmers of our poor island home, it is now time to strike back at our oppressors. The American Occupation humiliated our people and disgraced us beyond measure, so now we must build that pride back up. To motivate the people to take back what was stolen from them, our administration has decreed that all true red sons and daughters of Haiti may strike back at our former puppet-masters without retribution from our state. Furthermore, new state action has been planned against the largest vestiges of American influence, promising to clear out these ratnests of Yankee filth while redistributing the seized assets to the people or stashing them away in funds for future state projects. With this announcement, many of the remaining American and European administrators and elites foolish enough to have stayed here this long have fled, with the few left behind facing the ire of our people. Imperialism’s mark will be expunged from our nation forever more."
haiti.24.a:0 "We are puppets no longer."

haiti.25.t:0 "Favor Urban Syndicates"
haiti.25.d:0 "With the victory of the Haitian Proletariat over the Bourgeoisie and their imperialist backers, the time has finally come for the building up of Socialism on Hispaniola to take place. However, there is a small hindrance to the just will of the workers. To say Haiti lacked an urban population would be an understatement, and while the workers do indeed lead our new society, their numbers are fair and few between. In order therefore to both increase our urban population and the amount of workers in the few factories we do have, an ingenuous plan has been concocted. A series of reforms, most notable a litany of tax cuts, have been passed in order to sway the rural populace to begin moving to the cities. Further, preexisting worker syndicates have been granted a large amount of power and autonomy, to finally put the working man in charge of his own industry. A campaign to organize other syndicates has also begun. Slowly but surely the Haitian worker will dig himself out and build a shining beacon to the glory of Socialism for the world to see."
haiti.25.a:0 "Favor Port-Au-Prince!"

haiti.26.t:0 "Efficient Civil Conscription"
haiti.26.d:0 "Civil conscription, or the forcing of citizens to perform mandatory labor for the state, has a long history in Haiti. Even forgetting our roots in the slave trade, after our independence was won from France, native Haitians were still conscripted by the new Black-led government to carry out hard labor once done by slaves. Though it may have its moral complications to some, our state views it differently. It is part of our history, our culture, as well as being the bedrock of any stable and prosperous Haitian state. Despite its long history here, it is a woefully disorganized and dreadful business that must be modernized and made efficient. New reforms have been enacted to not only give these forced labourers better, safer conditions, but have also concriptied far more of them for our state’s use, chiefly from the many criminals that fill our jails or other lowlifes of our society. It shall be their way of redemption and our way of obtaining free labor to better suit our rapidly growing economy."
haiti.26.a:0 "It is their duty to serve."

haiti.27.t:0 "Overhaul the CFC"
haiti.27.d:0 "The Chemins de Fer de la Caraïbes, or CFC, is the largest rail line in the nation; a relic from the French imperialist regime. Since their departure with our revolution over a century ago, it has received extensions from the Germans, the French, and the Americans all in petty attempts at further exploitation and economic imperialism. With these oppressive regimes now longer calling the shots in our nation, we have an opportunity to overhaul the CFC and create a truly Haitian railway. New, modern engines will be used and the newest advancements in rail and locomotive technology will be imported for our own use, while also allowing our scientists and engineers to attempt to reverse engineer their advancements for our own purposes down the line. This new CFC will rise from the ashes of imperialism and carry the Haitian people into modernity!"
haiti.27.a:0 "All rails will lead to Port-au-Prince."

haiti.28.t:0 "Rapid Electrification"
haiti.28.d:0 "Haiti lacks many things most other nations in North America are accustomed to in this modern age, but the most glaring deficit is Haiti’s utter travesty of an electrical grid. With well under half of the nation having any regular access to electricity, and constant electricity only occasionally possible in the largest cities in the nation, much of our populace lives in the dark, relying on more archaic methods to achieve illumination, refrigeration or preservation, cooking, and many other everyday activities. This must be rectified immediately! With our abundance of charcoal, as well as the little amount of regular coal, natural gas, and oil we receive by trade, we must make a concerted effort to light up the night skies of Haiti permanently. With electricity, comes progress!"
haiti.28.a:0 "If we are to be a modern nation, our people can no longer live in the shadows."

haiti.29.t:0 "End the Obsession with Charcoal"
haiti.29.d:0 "Charcoal, or charbon in the local kreyòl ayisyen dialect, is one of the most important industries in Haiti as, due to our crippling lack of natural oil reserves, burning charcoal amounts for nearly all energy production throughout the nation. To fuel this rampant need for charcoal, massive orchards of  Mesquite, Neem, and Kasya trees have been planted across the island, consuming valuable, scarce free land with every seed sown. Though ideally cut above the roots so as to allow the tree to regrow, the quicker practice of lighting entire orchards alight at once has taken off, creating large amounts of usable charcoal that can be further dried and cured after collection in a short period of time. This practice leaves much of the land it leaves behind untillable for quite awhile, slowly eliminating arable land, while also further accelerating our deforestation as new land must be cleared while the old land rejuvenates, or when these fires spiral out of control and spread into Haiti’s few remaining virgin groves. This reckless practice must be outlawed and stopped at once to allow our nation’s forests to heal, instead being replaced with the more sustainable above-the-root cutting method until a better alternative fuel source can be found in ready supply."

haiti.30.t:0 "Embrace Noirist Thought"
haiti.30.d:0 "The Noirisme movement’s influence is felt far and  wide across Haiti, influencing socialists like Roumain, liberals like Price-Mars, and of course the nationalists like Brouard and his protege Duvalier. The movement is a strange fusion of pan-Africanism, nationalism, and populism with racial connotations, vaguely socialist and integralist ties, and a deep disdain for imperialism. This intense fusion of varied ideas are unique to our island home, and has rapidly become one of the most dominant philosophical, artistic, and political strands in the nation. The ideals championed by the Noiristes should be expanded to form the foundation for our new economic system. With the influence of Noirisme, we shall drift further and further into a racially-based populist economy; one that reaches out a hand to help the Afro-Haitians and not the the foul Whites and mixed breeds that have led this nation’s economy for so long and with it, strangled the true Haitain people"

haiti.31.d:0 "Just under a century and a half ago, our forefathers raised their fists in solidarity with one another, marching side by side in their struggle against our old imperial masters in Paris. When our fathers broke their chains, it was not to fold their arms or watch and let their fellow brother toil under them! It was to free all Haitians and elevate them to a position of equality. Though history has played its tricks on our people, and our independence was only temporary and true equality was never achieved, the spirit of these forefathers was never forgotten. As the great Oswald Durand once wrote, ‘Independence is fugitive, without the right of equality! To plough this soil with joy, we need this strict motto: God! Labour! Freedom! ’ We shall make these righteous words echo throughout our regime. True equality shall be granted to all true sons and daughters of Haiti in both economic and political arenas, while the motto ‘God! Labour! Freedom!’ shall help form the core philosophy of our new direction. By infusing our tradition of fighting against injustice with modern concepts, such as from the Noirisme and Negritude movements, we shall create a new economic system that finally benefits true Haitians the most, particularly the most down-trodden of our kin: the Afro-Haitians. Following the spirit of L'Ouverture and Dessalines, Haiti will look to its past as it catapults itself into the future, a future all true Haitians can revel in."

haiti.32.t:0 "Transform the Bureaucracy"
haiti.32.d:0 "Since the rise of our red government, we have had to deal with the incessant obstacles put forward by the various reactionary bureaucrats that still infest our nation. Even now, they further seek to rot the foundations of our new worker’s republic before we can even fully take hold ourselves, and these termites will stop at nothing to achieve their goal of toppling our state from within. This must not come to pass! All those who fill our administrative positions, bureaucracy, or who manage the civil service and affairs of the state in any way shall all be scrutinized under thorough investigation for any reactionary sympathies they may hold. True workers and proletarians have nothing to hide; only the swindlers and conmen of the Right and the Bourgeoisie have anything to truly fear. From the ground up, our entire administration will be swept from top to bottom and cleansed of any traitors to our glorious revolution, and Roumain shall lead the way!"

haiti.33.d:0 "'What are we? Since that's your question, I'm going to answer you. We're this country, and it wouldn't be a thing without us, nothing at all. Who does the planting? Who does the watering? Who does the harvesting? Coffee, cotton, rice, sugar cane, caco, corn, bananas, vegetables, and all the fruits, who's going to grow them if we don't? Yet with all that, we're poor, that's true. We're out of luck, that's true. We're miserable, that's true. But do you know why, brother? Because of our ignorance. We don't know yet what a force we are, what a single force - all the peasants, all the Negroes of the plain and hill, all united. Some day, when we get wise to that, we'll rise up from one end of the country to the other. Then we'll call a General Assembly of the Masters of the Dew, a great big coumbite of farmers and we'll clear out poverty and plant a new life.” - an excerpt from ‘Masters of the Dew,’ written and published by Chairmen Jacques Roumain, transcribed to English by one Langston Hughes."

haiti.34.t:0 "The French Model"
haiti.34.d:0 "Though once towering over a world-spanning imperialist empire, the Paris regime now finds itself as the leader of the International and of the global worker’s struggle against imperialism and capitalism; an ironic twist of fate for our former masters. With our state’s recent transition into a truly socialist government, Jacques Roumain, the father of the Haitian revolution and modern leftism in the nation, has shocked the nation and snubbed his nose at the past hatred between our two nations as he has begun to adopt more and more anarcho-syndicalist practices from the Commune of France itself. Using their model as a guideline for how to build up true syndicalism in Haiti, Roumain’s ambitions plans would see the creation of a highly centralized form of democratic syndicalism where communes and worker’s syndicates around the nation would work and maintain their own sectors internally, but would all debate and vote within one larger centralized governing body headed by Roumain himself. Though seemingly far less 'anarcho' and far more 'syndicalist', Roumain and his faction in the Haitian Syndicalist Party believe this to be the only model that will work to finally bring both stability and prosperity to the Haitian people."
haiti.34.a:0 "Paris continues to influence Port-au-Prince, no matter how the world changes."

haiti.35.t:0 "End the Rivalries"
haiti.35.d:0 "Harsh and venomous political rivalries have long existed in Haiti, even before the Americans came and stirred the unstable pot of Haitian politics. Socialists, liberals, conservatives, and nationalists have all long argued and debated in the chambers of our government while openly brawling or even killing each other in the streets and rural barrens after sessions end. We must mend this rift, lest our nation be torn apart in the process. New and sincere attempts at achieving a dialogue amongst these varied factions is a must, and there is one thing we can all agree on to start these needed peace talks: Haiti is for Haitians, and it must be made that way once and for all. American and European exploitation of our people has gone on for centuries, making our people weak and disgraced. This foul course must be reversed! All the parties and political groups of our nation can agree on that solid fact, and with that shared base point, future political cooperation and bi-partisanship may actually be possible. Max Hudicourt shall lead the way and help guide these warring ideological groups work together to build a stronger and more independent Haiti."
haiti.35.a:0 "At the end of the day, we all just want to help our long-downtrodden people."

haiti.36.t:0 "Repudiate Radical Noirism"
haiti.36.d:0 "Of all of our political enemies, there is but one we cannot ignore or work with if we are to achieve true prosperity on this island: the Noiriste. These overzealous nationalist fanatics will only cause further trouble as their divisive ideas sow divisions into our ranks. Their siren song lures the disillusioned from both the Left and the Right, and so we must cut the head off this serpent before they lure anymore good Haitians to their damned cause. To confront this nationalistic siren, President Max Hudicourt must decide on one of two plans he has concocted to combat Noirisme’s influence. He could specifically single out the radical Noiristes themselves as the source of the issue, who, in Hudicourt’s words, are perverting the ideas and merits of Haitian culture and using them for their own selfish pursuits. This would likely anger the radical nationalist elements of the movement while still leaving the rest of our support base intact, as we would still support Noirisme and similar strains as a uniquely Haitian cultural phenomena, while cleansing it of its hateful taint. Alternatively, we could flat out denounce Noirisme entirely, hopefully removing its influence from our government for good while also angering a far larger group of Haitians aside from just zealous nationalists. Regardless of our dear leader’s decision, the Noirstes shall remain to be a thorn in our side for some time until our policies and governance shows these lost and wayward sons of Haiti their way back into the flock."
haiti.36.a:0 "A repugnant perversion of Haitian culture and pride. Ban all traces of Noirisme at once!"
haiti.36.b:0 "Though it suffers from nationalistic taint, Noirisme still has its benefits. Repudiate only the radicals."

haiti.37.t:0 "Smash the Church"
haiti.37.d:0 "Religion is incredibly pervasive in Haiti, with both Roman Catholicism and native Vodou practices being incredibly common across our island nation. While religion itself is not an issue in Hudicourt’s eyes, organized religion is when it interferes with matters of the state. The Catholic Church has pressed its boot and dulled the minds of the Haitian proletariat since the first missionaries arrived on white-capped ships centuries ago. Since then, the dominance and influence of the Church has only grown, becoming one of the largest non-farmland landowners in the nation as well as sticking its fingers in our coffers as often as it can under the pretense of tithes and other unnecessary nonsense. Our people may still have their beliefs and attend their masses, but the power that Rome and the rest of the Catholic Church has over Haiti shall be stripped at once. Special tax exemptions to Church property and officials will be rescinded, active clergymen will be banned from running for public office or holding government positions, and a secularization campaign will be run by the state to cleanse all Church influence from within the current government. May our people be pious and spiritual, but may the Church never meddle in our affairs again."
haiti.37.a:0 "The Papacy shall no longer exploit Haiti and its people for their own gain."

haiti.38.t:0 "A Professional Bureaucracy"
haiti.38.d:0 "A new and modern bureaucracy will be needed if we are to efficiently and appropriately run our state. Our new bureaucrats must be loyal to the nation above all else, and will be drafted from loyal civil servants and other proven workers that support our government above all others. This will occur while we actively exclude the myriad of radical groups that flank us on either side. Our new administration shall be an oasis of placidity and diligence in the chaotic maelstrom that is Haitian politics, and we will try to keep our new pencil-pushers as apolitical as possible in order to ensure their professionalism and unbiasedness in their deeply important work. They will each stand as an individual cog in a larger machine, and so each and every cog must be just right."
haiti.38.a:0 "Professionalism is more important than blind loyalty."

haiti.39.t:0 "A Haitian Cultural Renaissance"
haiti.39.d:0 "With our state growing ever more stable and prosperous, a sort of cultural golden age has begun to foment within Haiti. With emphasis on Haitian music, art, dance, food, writing, poetry, and any other facet of high or low society, this Haitian Renaissance began both in the salons of Port-au-Prince and the slums of Cap-Haitien, uplifting Haitians from across the nation and across regular socioeconomic barriers. Movements like Noirisme and Negritude were popular with many of the artists and performers, while Vodou spiritualism and ideas of “Haitianization” were common as well given their recent rises after the fall of the American Occupation. While the rest of the world readies for war or burns to the ground, for once it is Haiti that gets to dance the nights away as if not a thing in the world was amiss..."

haiti.40.t:0 "Political Equilibrium"
haiti.40.d:0 "If our twinking rose of a republic for all Haitians is to survive at all, political equilibrium must be established. Much like an animal maintaining homeostasis, a nation’s government must also constantly regulate itself, intaking and outputting as needed, in order to function properly. To this end, Démosthènes Calixte has moved to reach out to all political parties within our nation to voice the need for cooperation. What is good for Haiti’s government currently is good for all Hatitans, is his argument, as Calixte’s government stands for all Haitians equally. We will do as an organism would; we will take in the good and expel the bad, taking in advice and thoughts from all sides of the aisle so that Haiti may move forward as one, while also expelling any harmful or uncooperative elements from the equation. Though it will take much time and effort before the cracks separate us are repaired or bridged, Calixte and his government are hard at work, and the results are already beginning to show."

haiti.41.t:0 "Haitianization"
haiti.41.d:0 "Since the rise and fall of the American Occupation, Haitian culture has been rapidly eroded under the jackboots of American Marines and Haitian traitors. With the collapse of the Borno regime and the establishment of a true democracy here in our state, a process of ‘Haitianization’ must be carried out in order to wipe the American’s taint from our lands. English will once more cease to be spoken on our island as our own dialect of Creole, kreyòl ayisyen, takes hold as the main tongue of our nation, with the dual aims of supplanting basal French and English and driving their imperialist tongues from our lands. The Hatian gourde will be supported to rise past both the Franc and Dollar. Haitian history and culture will be taught in every classroom, Vodou and native Haitian Catholicism will be emphasized, and any other trace of our former oppressors will be wiped clean from Haiti as much as possible. Though the growing pains may be immense as we get acclimated to life on our own and as our own, we must never forget why we are doing this: we do this for every Haitian forced to toil, bleed, or die under the hands of foreigners, for every slave left to die and every servant left to starve. We do this for every Haitian robbed of their homes, their culture, their history, their lives. We do this for all true Haitans, for they above most deserve a free and sovereign home to themselves."

haiti.42.t:0 "Eliminate Political Bovarysme"
haiti.42.d:0 "Ideological titan and father of the Haitian liberal movement, Jean Price-Mars is one of the most dominant ideologues in the nation. One of his unique ideas is the concept of 'collective bovarysme' which he coined to refer to the small but arrogant group of mixed-races Elites predominantly composed of European-descendant rich landowners. These affluent slobs sit atop the hierarchy of Haiti while over 90% of our nation is of African descent. The Afro-Haitians must be uplifted and given voice and power, while these false sons of Haiti must be cast out and relegated to be ruled by true Black patriots. No longer will we allow a small percentage of our nation to dictate the terms of rule! The time for enfranchisement and the return of their honor is upon all Afro-Haitians across our island home."

haiti.43.t:0 "A Beacon of De-Radicalization"
haiti.43.d:0 "Though radicals continue to gnaw at our base, we have finally found us a true shield to wield in defense against these ideological fanatics: Jean Price-Mars. A staunch liberal and face of the liberal-conservative coalition that has stood as the bulwark for democracy in Haiti, Price-Mars is one of the most respected men in the nation. Much of this respect comes from his unique array of ideas he personally espouses, while also actively contributing to each movement and idea’s bodies of work. With roots and works published in medicine, ethnology, Pan-Africanism, Negritude, Afro-nationalism, and many other fields, Price-Mars is not only a valued intellectual but also a ture Haitian patriot in the eyes of most people in the nation, regardless of their political affiliation. Due to his reputation and prestige, Price-Mars has become a beacon, attracting former members of our coalition who have been led astray in recent years by the siren song of radicalism. With Jean Price-Mars and other true sons of Haiti like him, our liberal-conservative alliance stands a chance at weathering this storm of radicalization and come out the other side stronger than ever."

As we stand now, united and stronger before ever before, we must come together as one to continue our leap into prosperity and modernity. Before splitting the hairs on what separates us, one thing above all unites us against all others: we are Haitian. This singular identity is all that keeps us from tripping into complete collapse, but it is no weak bond. Our national pride and heritage is stronger than steel, forged through centuries of oppression, imperialism, and chaos. Our bonds have been forged in a history so tragic many can not bear to reminisce, and with these bonds Haiti is only stronger for it. With our past behind us, we must march into the future together, not knowing what lies ahead. But regardless of what does await us down our path, we will face it head-on and together as a one and united Haitian people."

haiti.45.d:0 "Our current and majestic monarch, King Faustin II, is, as his name implies, the second to bear his great name. Long before his reign almost a century ago, the ex-slave turned national ruler Faustin I ruled as ‘Emperor Faustin-Élie Soulouque,Emperor of Hayt’ from 1849 until his forced abdication and exile caused his reign to end in 1859. As Emperor, Soulouque was renowned as a veteran of the Haitian revolution and fair ruler to the poor and downtrodden of Haito. Cleansing the bureaucracy of mixed elites and filling it with black loyalists, embracing Vodou, and creating a secret police, he ruled with a velvet fist, brutal against his opponents and fair to his people. Our noble King Faustin II seeks to emulate his greatness with every waking minute, without the tyrannical reputation that tarnished Faustin I’s reputation forevermore. He is Faustin II, heir to the throne of the Empire of Haiti and champion of the Haitian people like his namesake before him."

Every decree, every policy, every decision of this fine state is done so for the good of the people of Haiti. From the lowliest Afro-Haitian farmer to the highest Mulatto business tycoon, all are equal and free under King Faustin II. To lessen the plight of these fine people, our glorious king has announced a new series of reforms that will mold the Haitian state into a far more caring nation, granting support, aid, and modern amenities like healthcare and education to all true sons and daughters of our island home. Under our righteous king, the Haitian people shall be lifted up from the sludge they have found themselves in for centuries and be brought into the light of honor and modernity."

haiti.47.d:0 "As we put out the fires caused by the American Occupation, a new blaze has ignited across the Caribbean Sea in our former lording neighbors as they descend into their second civil war in a century. Their hubris shall be to the benefit of our brothers overseas in the Black Belt who have itched for independence ever since their forced arrival on this continent; a common heritage we share. With our African-descdended brothers in the American south taking up arms, we could throw in with their cause, sending aid and troops at the least, or even possibly direct intervention on their behalf, to aid in their struggle against the tyrannical Constitutional American Republic. However, this would also cast Haitian lives to die in a foreign war, in the land of our past oppressors no less, and would most likely anger a large group of the population, at least until we enlightened them to the righteousness of the Black Belt rebel’s cause. The final choice however, is up to His Majesty, King Faustin II."

haiti.48.d:0 "Haiti is a rich nation with a vibrant and storied past and culture to match. As the era of slavery and regime of the French Imperialists, or the American Occupation ravaged our nation, our culture slowly blossomed, despite constant attempts at its unrooting. With their shackles broken, the Haitian people were finally allowed to let their traditions openly show, accelerating its growth and further expanding uniquely Haitian ideas first developed under past imperialist regimes, like Noirisme and Negritude, or ‘Creole Communism’ and Pan-Africanism. Even their traditional religions have flourished, with Vodou also making a massive resurgence. All of these modern ideologies and movements have mixed with the traditional native culture of Haiti, and aspects of all of these movements must be drawn from, for not only are many of their varied ideas sound and useful, but also by drawing from all of the varied native Haitian group’s ideas and traditions, we shall be able to create a truly unite and Haitian kingdom under the saviour King Faustin II, the true champion of the native Haitian people.

To further gain capital, military equipment, and vital intel, which will all be needed to help keep his regime afloat until a stable foundation can be established, Duvalier has concocted an ingenious plan: raiding the armories, barracks, and bases that house the few remaining pockets of the American Marines that used to control Haiti’s with their every whim. Though these Yankees still lie in wait, heavily armed and well-trained, we must clear out these ratnests if our rule is ever to fully cement itself. With their loot plundered and their hidey-holes burned away, Haiti will finally become free from foreign influence and imperialism once and for all, and François Duvalier will get us there!"

After hours of bloodshed that lasted until long after the new sun rose in the East, Duvalier’s forces stood victorious, though beaten and bloodied, over the American lapdogs. Though the fighting was fierce and dozens were slain, Duvalier survived the onslaught and called a press conference to address the nation shortly after the smoke cleared the site of the battle. Slamming his would-be assassins and their leaders Franck Lavaud and Gerald Thomas in his speech, Duvalier remarked that if these Yanks spent less time stuffing their pockets and more time training their men with real tactics and discipline, then maybe this group of armed farmers and teenage conscripts might have fared better. Though his speech wasn’t all vitriol, taking a moment to honor the legacy of the few Haitians slain as both a true sons of Haiti and true heroes of the Haitian people, Duvalier has made clear that further actions like this would not be tolerated again, and that next time, the response would not be as cordial. Regardless of his specific words however, ‘Papa Doc’ made it clear on that podium that day that he was here to stay, and Haiti would have to get used to it."

To facilitate this ‘dire need’ for funds, Duvalier has initiated an imposing system of property confiscation, seizing assets from the mixed race elites and landowners, while also diverting funds from any incoming foreign or business dealings. By striking his fingers in multiple streams of cash flow, Papa Doc seeks to massively increase Haiti’s and his own fortunes simultaneously. Though some of his opponents have voiced their concern over the sheer amount of funds Papa Doc was diverting into his own accounts, these vocal critics soon weren’t heard from again to make much of a lasting impact on the President’s plans. François ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier will build up the economy of Haiti through whatever means necessary, even if open racketeering and extortion are what he must resort to, as only he understands that Haiti, and by extension himself, comes first above all."

Pulling inspiration from our Vodou spirituality, Catholic healing techniques, and new modern Haitian science, our doctors and hospitals shall be able to pull from a vast bank of knowledge, both old and new, in order to heal and nurse the many sick and feeble souls who inhabit our nation. Though this has worried some, our loving President ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier has assured all that Vodou is no mere religion, but a philosophy and a science as well.

This constant state of flux has only been worsened by the fact that the border region is absolutely full of native Haitians who work in the region, primarily in agricultural industries. Normally this situation is tumultuous but civil, but recently the Dominican Republic’s ruling regime has repeatedly espoused and promoted anti-Haitian rhetoric and has sent troops and police into the border zone to enforce their idea of ‘peace.’ \n\nEven worse, there have been reports from the Haitian worker hovel-town of Monte Cristi in the border region that Dominican security forces have begun to impose harsh policies against our Haitain laborers, and some have even been beaten or killed.

Even better, the Haitians have offered to be assimilated into the West Indies Federation, under the conditions that it be allowed to change the name of the new state as it sees fit and that the capitol be moved to Port-au-Prince. Granting this request could help stabilize the region, and allow us to focus our thin resources elsewhere, but we could also lose our grip on the area in the process. Preempting our hesitation, the Haitian delegation has already offered to further tweak the deal to further suit our interests. They have offered to grant both the Algiers Regime and our administration here in Ottawa full and sovereign control of Suriname and French Guiana, and Guyana respectively, returning these lands to their former colonial masters directly. On top of this, they have also offered to have the West Indies’ navy leave port immediately and set sail for Canadian waters in order to return to our proud command; an enticing offer given our improved state making it no longer necessary to leave the Exiled navy separated.

However, this deal was accepted more easily than our diplomats originally imagined, and perhaps we could ask for more concessions. Doing so, however, could endanger the deal..."
haiti.62.a:0 "The deal is fine as is!"
haiti.62.b:0 "Explain why we need the ships here!"

haiti.63.t:0 "The Canadians respond!"
haiti.63.d:0 "To our delight, the Canadians have accepted our offer! We will guard the Caribbean for them using the old West Indies fleet while the rest of the Entente maintains control over the Guinea Shield. This is an amicable deal for all parties involved, and we look forward to a new future for the Caribbean region."
haiti.63.a:0 "Wonderful news!"

haiti.64.t:0 "The Canadians respond!"
haiti.64.d:0 "Much to our dismay, the Canadians have informed us today that they will be declining our offer. It seems they do not trust us enough to control the area, or are otherwise unwilling to give up the vital resources and geographical positions the area has to offer. This is a setback for our nation, but we will march on nonetheless!"
haiti.64.a:0 "Horrible!"

haiti.65.t:0 "The Haitians make a counter-offer"
haiti.65.d:0 "Today we have received a counter-offer from the Haitian government, stunning many of our diplomats who expected an easy deal. Perhaps they saw our willingness to rid ourselves of the West Indies, and know we desperately need a better administration in the area. Regardless, they have requested that we let them keep the ships of the old Federation, so that they will be better able to defend the area for the Entente. Should we accept this counteroffer and lose face?"
haiti.65.a:0 "If we must..."
haiti.65.b:0 "Not a chance!"

haiti.66.t:0 "A Demand for Kreyol Unity"
haiti.66.d:0 "The great Haitian state has grown from a weak and corrupt republic crumbling under American corruption into a beacon of Pan-African unity in our pearlescent Caribbean Sea. However, Haiti is not just African, but Kreyol as well! We forged this culture in the wake of European oppression, taking what good we could from their wretched traditions and fusing it with our own to create something truly unique; a culture befitting our people who were robbed from the home continent. With our regime now raising its mighty flag across this verdant archipelago, we now eye the last eden of Kreyol culture still left languishing under foregin control: Lwizyana. Our Pan-African brothers in the Black Belt Republic now own this land, and it is in our people’s best interests to demand this territory from them, for it is in Papa Doc’s best interests, and Papa Doc is the Haitian people."
haiti.66.a:0 "Send the ‘request’ at once!"

haiti.67.t:0 "A Request for Creole Unity"
haiti.67.d:0 "With our recent acquisitions in our fight for freedom, we now hold large swathes of the American South. With so much land, stability and unity have been key concerns of our administration, especially with the rise of more unruly elements in our more extraneous territories. One such problem area, growing ever more rife with civil unrest, is the former Union state of Louisiana, and a possible solution to our issues has surfaced. A strange and stern request from Haitian president François ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier, noted Pan-African nationalist autocrat, has arrived on our desk. In a strongly worded ‘request’ letter bordering on a demand, this ‘Papa Doc’ has asked for our regime to transfer administrative rights and control of Louisiana in the name of “Pan-African cooperation and Creole unity” in the words of the Haitian dictator. We could fulfil this request, cementing cooperation between the two prominent majority-Black states in the New World, and relieving ourselves of the headache of Cajun rebels and Longist remnants. However, this would also deeply offend many in our young nation, especially the more nationalist elements. How shall we respond?"
haiti.67.a:0 "Acquiesce Papa Doc’s request in the name of unity and cooperation between our two great states."
haiti.67.b:0 "Refuse this madman at once!"

haiti.68.t:0 "The [BBR.GetName] Declines Our Offer!"
haiti.68.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, the [BBR.GetName] has declined our request for Louisiana. It is true that this was a longshot offer, but we were hoping that they would be more willing to work together..."
haiti.68.a:0 "A shame!"

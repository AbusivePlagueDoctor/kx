### Events ###
kyr.1.t:0 "Stronghold of Central Asian Democracy"
kyr.1.d:0 "While it is hard to say that the Republic of Kokand is a real stronghold of Central Asian Democracy, its regime is far more liberal than of its neighbour, Emirate of Bukhara. After the February Revolution in Russia, party 'Shura-i-Islam' was founded by liberal and democratic movement of Jadidists. Soon after the party split into two, the other wing represented the conservative movement of Islamic traditionalists - 'Shura-i-Ulema'. They won the first elections in the summer of 1917. After the Bolshevist putsch in Russia, the republic supported the Whites and proclaimed Kokand Autonomy, though never becoming dependent on Russia due to the lack of initiative from President Kerensky, who had his own problems in his country. Mustafa Shokay became a prime-minister of the new country and was later elected president in 1918.\n\nPerhaps, the main problem of the Kokand Republic is the confrontation between liberal Jadidists and conservative Kadimists. Shura-i-Ulema rejected to cooperate with the government of Kokand, and since then they have been in opposition with Shura-i-Islam gaining a slight majority at the elections.\n\nThe upcoming elections of 1936 will probably become the most uncertain in Kokand history as the population is tired of the presidency of Shokay."
kyr.1.a:0 "Interesting."

kyr.2.t:0 "The Upcoming Elections"
kyr.2.d:0 "The upcoming presidential elections of 1936 are going to be one of the most uncertain in the history of Kokand Republic. On the one hand, incumbent president Mustafa Shokay, who has been in office since 1917, is the representative of the Jadidist party, Shura-i-Islam. He's a kazakh and seeks further cooperation with Alash Autonomy, so that's why he is disliked by common Kyrgyz population of the region: he is seen as a Russian and Alash puppet leader. On the other hand, there is the candidate from the Kadimist party, Shura-i-Ulema, Sherali Lapin. He is a supporter of traditional values, and seeks cooperation with Basmachi. He also relies on German support and believes to make Kokand a part of panislamic state."
kyr.2.a:0 "Challenging."

kyr.3.t:0 "President's Speech"
kyr.3.d:0 "Mustafa Shokay, incumbent president, has delivered a speech just before the elections. He promised further cooperation with Russia and Alash Autonomy, increasing representation of other nations in the parliament and openly denounced the Kadimists, who, as he said, want to destroy the Republic and democracy and integrate into Emirate of Bukhara. He added that the citizens of Kokand Republic should do everything they can to save independence of the country."
kyr.3.a:0 "He's promising the same thing every time."

kyr.4.t:0 "Political Crisis in Russia"
kyr.4.d:0 "The assassination of Kerensky appeared to be a surprise for Mustafa Shokay. Now he cannot count on Russian assistance, and one of his main promises during his presidency cannot be implemented. This is a serious shock for his campaign and it seems that nothing can stop Shura-i-Ulema from finally winning the elections."
kyr.4.a:0 "What will he do now?"

kyr.5.t:0 "Young Khiva Victory"
kyr.5.d:0 "There have been reports about the liberalisation of Khiva's regime. It seems that Basmachi have lost their power in Khiva and it is a serious threat to Bukhara and Kadimist influence. It seems that now Shura-i-Ulema can rely only on Bukhara."
kyr.5.a:0 "The Khanate is over."

kyr.6.t:0 "The Regime Changed in Bukhara"
kyr.6.d:0 "Now the Emirate of Bukhara encounters some political changes. The Emir seems to finally give up and the rule of Basmachi in Bukhara has ended."
kyr.6.a:0 "Finally, a friendly regime in Bukhara."
kyr.6.b:0 "We're the last true political force."

kyr.7.t:0 "1936 Presidential Elections"
kyr.7.d:0 "Finally, today the citizens of Kokand Republic will vote for their leader."
kyr.7.a:0 "Mustafa Shokay, Jadidists."
kyr.7.b:0 "Sherali Lapin, Kadimists."

kyr.8.t:0 "Abdulkadyr Mukhitdinov Enters Kokand"
kyr.8.d:0 "The [TRK.GetNameDef] has recently had to deal with socialist insurgency in the Karakum. Hopefully for them, the uprising was crushed, but unfortunately for us, Mukhitdinov has crossed the border and is now hiding somewhere in Kokand."
kyr.8.a:0 "Find him and arrest him!"
kyr.8.b:0 "Leave him alone - it's unlikely he will rebel."

kyr.9.t:0 "Socialist Insurgency in Tashkent"
kyr.9.d:0 "It was stupid to think that the socialist movement in Kokand is weak. Formally, the Union of Muslim Workers is represented by Nazir Torekulov in Kokand, but he's unlikely to be a big threat. However, with the arrival of Mukhitdinov, he managed to raise an uprising in industrial region of Tashkent."
kyr.9.a:0 "Send there troops."

kyr.10.t:0 "Mukhitdinov Proclaims Workers' Republic in Tashkent"
kyr.10.d:0 "Abdulkadyr Mukhitdinov has proclaimed a socialist republic in Tashkent. While the idea is being a nonsense, he's still a threat and he's supported by many proletarians in Tashkent."
kyr.10.a:0 "Liquidate the unrest at any cost."
kyr.10.b:0 "Ask Bukhara for help."

kyr.11.t:0 "Kokand Asks for Help"
kyr.11.d:0 "The government of Kokand has asked us to intervene in Tashkent and help the liquidate the socialist unrest in the region."
kyr.11.a:0 "Sure."
kyr.11.b:0 "Destabilized Kokand is better for us."

kyr.12.t:0 "Bukhara Intervenes in Tashkent."
kyr.12.d:0 "The government of [TRK.GetNameDef] agreed to intervene in Tashkent. Our joint forces have liquidated the unrest. Mukhitdinov was murdered and the uprising was suppressed."
kyr.12.a:0 "Victory!"

kyr.13.t:0 "Bukhara Refused to Intervene."
kyr.13.d:0 "Bukhara refused to intervene and help us to liquidate the unrest. Left alone, it will be harder for us to suppress the uprising."
kyr.13.a:0 "At least we tried."

kyr.14.t:0 "Socialists Crushed"
kyr.14.d:0 "We managed to crush socialist protesters. Insigator of uprising, Abdulkadyr Mukhitdinov has been murdered and it seems nothing can stop us now from achieving our goals."
kyr.14.a:0 "Victory!"

kyr.15.t:0 "Mukhitdinov Overthrows the Government."
kyr.15.d:0 "The protesters not only managed to repulse our forces, but many of the soliders refused to kill the protesters. The uprising was supported in Pishkek as well. The revolutionnaries seized administrative buildings in Pishkek and Mukhitdinov has arrived into the capital. Later that day he proclaimed the People's Republic of Turkestan."
kyr.15.a:0 "Workers of the world, unite!"

POLITICS_PETR_KRASNOV_DESC:0 "The Krasnov Clan is perhaps the most famous among the Don Cossacks, its members have been generals, officers and intellectuals, and Pyetr Krasnov was just the most recent manifestation of this heritage. Though raised as a Cossack, Krasnov is extremely well read - he holds great interest in literature and writes fiction, has studied the nations of the Far East and Africa while serving in the Life Guards Ataman Regiment, and was even an acquaintance of Tsar Nikolay II himself. Having risen to lead the Regiment, he swore fealty to the Provisional Government, but did not hold warm feelings towards it, and so chose to not save Kerensky during the October Revolution. When he arrived back to his home in the Don Host, he was elected their Ataman and announced a crusade against the revolution in the north.\n\nThe Don Cossacks would prove to be the most loyal and effective force among the South Russian Whites, and periodically received German support, which the Ataman did not forget. Once the Bolshevik revolution concluded, Krasnov returned to his Host, but the Republic in Moscow did not leave him satisfied. The Tsar was nowhere close to being restored, the Republic itself was weak, and Krasnov personally despised Kerensky. During the Kolchak Coup of 1925, he decided to strike. Supported by German arms and a clique of loyal officers, he organized his own putsch in Rostov-on-Don, moved onto the rest of the Don-Caucasian region, and cut all ties with the regime in Moscow. The Kaiser's support meant that Russia was forced to back down, although it claims the region to this day. Krasnov continues to run the clique as a personalistic regime, suppressing all of Kuban Host's calls for union with Ukraine and keeping the North Caucasian tribes down. For now."

dkb.1.d:0 "The Don Republic was proclaimed by Pyetr Krasnov on the 18th of May 1918, when he was elected as the 'Ataman' ('Leader') of the Don Cossacks. Since then Krasnov, who used to be a connecting link between the leadership of the White Army and the Germans, started to strengthen his regime in South Russia, by improving his relations with the separatist leaders of the Kuban and Terek Cossacks. With the German help Don-Kuban Union could finally break away from Russia, which Krasnov as the Ataman of the Union condemned for its new republican system, using the conservative and pro-monarchist feelings of the South Russian population. But the new established Union still have to face with lots of problems. The lack of modern industry weakens the army of the Union, the people want land redistribution and reunification with Russia, separatist tensions in various parts of the Caucasus grow. If Pyetr Krasnov wants to stay as the Ataman of the Don Republic, he will have to deal with all these problems in his country."

This authority has a right to discuss almost every significant question, which has relation to the life in the country. Though Krasnov can promulgate his orders even without the approval of the 'Krug', but he has to consider its opinion in every case, if he wants to remain in control over the Don."

dkb.5.b:0 "Kalmyks should be free (Play as Kalmykia)"

dkb.6.t:0 "Bogaewsky Criticize Krasnov"
dkb.6.d:0 "Bogaewsky, the leader of the pro-Russian faction in the Cossack Circle has criticized Krasnov and denounced his policy of appeasing the Germans. With the Berlin Stock Crisis and Germany slowly loosing its supreme role in the world politics, cooperation with them won't bring stability to the country."
dkb.6.a:0 "He's only talking."

dkb.7.t:0 "Radicalization of the Circle"
dkb.7.d:0 "After the Bogaewsky's speech, the Cossack Circle has quickly become a verbal battlefield between pro-German and pro-Russian factions. Even if the Circle is not a parliament in any sense, they will have to negotiate and choose a side."
dkb.7.a:0 "Support Bogaewsky - Russia is an ally we need."
dkb.7.b:0 "Support Krasnov - Germany will protect us."

dkb.8.t:0 "Clashes in Rostov"
dkb.8.d:0 "After the Circle has decided to support Krasnov, Bogaewsky has been vigorously opposing the Circle. Almost all the pro-Russian cossacks have left the Circle. Yesterday saw violence on the streets of Rostov between Bogaewsky's and Krasnov's cossacks. We must immediately stop the civil unrest."

Krasnov has been arrested and Bogaewsky was proclaimed the new ataman by the loyal Cossack Circle."
dkb.10.a:0 "Glory to Bogaewsky!"

dkb.11.t:0 "Krasnov Secures His Power"
dkb.11.d:0 "The militia of Bogaewsky has been finally crushed with their leader arrested. Krasnov consolidated the grip over the Don Republic and stayed as the ataman. Now the Republc will face further cooperation with Germany."
dkb.11.a:0 "Glory to Krasnov!"

dkb.12.t:0 "'And Quiet Flows the Don'"
dkb.12.d:0 "A prominent young author, Mikhail Sholokhov, has published his monumental novel: 'And Quiet Flows the Don'. It tells a story about the Don Cossacks in the First World War and the Civil War, which combines several storylines. A conservative writer who was on the side of the Whites during the Civil War, Sholokhov devotes a significant place in the novel to the Red Cossacks, and his main character, Grigory Melekhov, at the end of the story never 'comes to the Whites'. While the novel received a lot of criticism for its pro-socialist ideology, many consider it to be a reaction towards Russian post-war policy. The novel is going to be translated into German, French and English and is said to become a bestseller both among leftist and rightist readers.
dkb.12.a:0 "A great book!"

dkb.13.t:0 "Dawn of the Red Don"
dkb.13.d:0 "The Don Republic has been finally liberated from the yokes of the capitalism. The Don People's Socialist Party, led by Chairman Syrtsov, has finally achieved the victory in the long class war against rich Cossacks, serving the German capital. Many things should be done before we can stay strong when the enemy will come to our land. The dawn of a new socialist republic has begun - and it will end only with the river Don painted dark red with our workers' blood. But we will fight and endure the rigours of this violent capitalist world."
dkb.13.a:0 "A good start."

dkb.14.t:0 "Syrtsov Delivers Speech"
dkb.14.d:0 "Chairman Syrtsov has delivered a speech in the centre of Rostov, in front of a square, crowded with workers and peasants. 'Hard times are coming, comrades. We should be more consolidated nowadays. We are surrounded by enemies, but the bright future is near. We will never surrender."

dkb.15.t:0 "Don Republic Wishes to Join Us"

dkb.16.t:0 "A New Russia?"
dkb.16.d:0 "Chairman Syrtsov has proclaimed our republic to become the successor of the first proletarian state, once lost in the history book. The legacy of Lenin lives on and his last hopes are concentrated in the hearts of fellow comrades, who live on the banks of the river Don."
dkb.16.a:0 "Let the world hear."

dkb.17.t:0 "Red Cossacks"
dkb.17.d:0 "During the Russian Civil War, the South of Russia was a great battlefield for all the sides. Here General Kornilov led the Volunteer Army, Denikin and Wrangel competed for the control of the South Russian Front, and, finally, various Soviet republics, established by our comrades were established. Chairman Syrtsov still remembers these times when he served as a Commissioner for National Economy and vice-chairman of the Don Soviet Republic. A lot of time has passed since those days and now Syrtsov leads the second socialist republic in Don. He will never forget the help of the cossacks that supported the Soviet power in this region. The so-called 'Red Cossacks' will help us this time as well - the cossacks are still respected amongs our population - and they will be eager to listen to the cossacks who are serving the proletariat."
dkb.17.a:0 "Cooperation instead of enmity."

dkb.18.t:0 "Gosplan"
dkb.18.d:0 "The new economy of the Don Republic should be planned. So the 'Gosplan' was established by chairman Syrtsov as an efficient state body that will carry out national planning for the development of the national economy and control over the implementation of national economic plans."
dkb.18.a:0 "Much better than the market."

dkb.19.t:0 "Private Property?"
dkb.19.d:0 "While the private property is generally banned in our republic, some officials believe that we should allow cooperatives to exist in the beginning. Not only will they ensure the cooperation between proletariat and peasantry and give them a stimulus to work, but also allow the state to implement a special tax for profit."
dkb.19.a:0 "Ban any private ownership."
dkb.19.b:0 "Allow cooperation."

dkb.22.t:0 "The Role of the Chairman"
dkb.22.d:0 "At this moment chairman Syrtsov has almost unlimited power, being a kind of a dictator in the country. From this perspective, he's not better than a good old Ataman Krasnov, who ruled our country for 15 years, being a German puppet and a cleptocrat. Some people in the party believe that the Chairman's role should be limited - not only by the parliamentary Council, but also by the party and the government. Syrtsov is a good man and a good leader - he won't confront the party in this question, but his authority is high enough to stifle initiative and consolidate power in his hands."

dkb.62.t:0 "Clashes in Rostov"

dkb.67.t:0 "Opposition to the Regime"
dkb.67.d:0 "Before the fall, the Russian state was a battlefield for many political factions, from the far-left ones to the far-right ones. The Russian society was very polarized, and it is even more polarized now - when our government rules all of Russia. Though we are Russians ourselves, from the people's view we are invaders.

dkb.67.a:0 "Cleanse the opposition."

dkb.68.t:0 "Fate of Socialist Parties"
dkb.68.d:0 "The second part of our regime stabilization is to solve the question what to do with socialists.

dkb.70.d:0 "The Ukrainian officials, who once tried to include Don region with our capital Yekaterinodar into Ukraine, but were stopped by Krasnov and the local Cossack and White armies, don't stop their attempts to gain an influence in our country. This time the Ukrainians propose us to acknowledge the Ukrainian language as the second official in Kuban. They have support from some members of the Kuban Cossacks in the 'Krug', who hopes that the Ukrainian help will allow them to strengthen their position in the country. On the contrary the Don Cossacks reject any agreement with the Ukrainians, since the Kingdom of Ukraine occupied a large part of the Don lands at the end of the Russian civil war."

But the Russians suppose that the Kalmyks took lots of the peasant's lands in Stavropol during the civil war and the government must launch a land redistribution in the northern part of Stavropol region. What should we do?"
dkb.80.a:0 "The Russians are right - give these lands back to them."

The Chechens has asked us to allow them use the Sharia law and have the Sharia courts. The Terek Cossacks think that this decision will lead to the radicalisation in this region and new clashes between the local Cossacks and the Chechens. That's why the Cossacks suppose that they should have a right to arrest the radical Muslim priests who use the rules of Islam to solve different cases in the Chechen region.

dkb.100.t:0 "Assassination attempt!"
dkb.100.d:0 "Today the Ataman's residence was attacked by a group of the unknown terrorists who obviously intended to kill our leader Pyots Krasnov! It seems that the main reason was the unpopular reforms, which provoked the instability in the Don-Kuban Union.

dkb.107.d:0 "In the old Russian Republic, the president was just a nominal figure, appointed by the Senate, who could do something only if the Duma and the Prime-Minister is on his side. This greatly destabilized the system and led to the assassination of Kerensky. In the new republic, as proposed by the Transitonal Government, the president should have full authority over the parliament and the executive branch."

DKU_Recovering_The_Economy_desc:0 "Our economy has fared well since the terrors of Black Monday first ravaged our financial state.

DKU_Rely_On_Germany_desc:0 "With our position in Europe and with the Russian Bear to the north, the Kaiserreich has long been interested in our state.

DKU_Rely_On_Russia_desc:0 "Russia, the closest World Power to our great state, has a long and turbid history with our people. Regardless, they are our best option to choose as a benefactor given their proximity and existing ties to our economy. In order to facilitate better relations between our two nations and rapidly repair our economy, we should rely on Germany in our future economic development."

DKU_Mechanization_Of_Agriculture:0 "Mechanization of Agriculture"
DKU_Mechanization_Of_Agriculture_desc:0 Our nation is still largely agricultural-base and agrarian, with much of the industry expected of a modern state sorely missing within our borders. We should take notes from the modern farming techniques used in other nations by mechanizing our agri-industry. With new motorized tractors, crop processing plants, and other wonders of the industrial age, we shall lift our farmers up out of the dirt and into the future."

DKU_Industrialize_Kuban:0 "Industrialize [ROOT.GetName]"
DKU_Industrialize_Kuban_desc:0 "With our deeply agrarian roots, industry has always been solely lacking within our nation. A sweeping industrialisation push is much needed for our country to compete with our neighbors in the region. The skies that rise high above our land between the two seas shall grow black with the smoke of progress as we burst forth into modernity!"

DKU_Subsidize_German_Business:0 "Subsidize German Business"
DKU_Subsidize_German_Business_desc:0 "In the wake of Black Monday, Germany has become our main trade partner and financial benefactor.

DKU_Duty_Free_For_Russians:0 "Duty-Free Policies For Russians"
DKU_Duty_Free_For_Russians_desc:0 "Since the economic collapse wrought by Black Monday, our financial ties with Moscow have only grown stronger.

DKU_Kuban_Oil_Production_desc:0 "The region of Ciscaucasia and the lands that straddle both the Black Sea and Caspian are blessed with bountiful reserves of oil.

DKU_Stabilization:0 "Stabilisation"
DKU_Stabilization_desc:0 "With a mountain of reforms and new policies passed, Black Monday is slowly becoming a distant memory to our people.

With the shock and collapse behind us, our economic future has never looked brighter."

DKU_A_Cossack_Army:0 "A Cossack Army"
DKU_A_Cossack_Army_desc:0 "Cossack heritage runs deep in our veins and martial traditions. We should capitalize on these roots and officially make Cossak strategy and customs a part of our armed forces. Their proud history shall become the bedrock of our modern military."

DKU_New_Doctrine_For_Cossacks_desc:0 "With the Russian Civil War and the Weltkrieg behind us and the threat of new war on the horizon, we can no longer rely on the stale theories of yesterday. New doctrine and strategum must be developed, and old ideas reformed and modernized, in order to stand a chance on the battlefields of tomorrow."

DKU_Import_German_Equipment:0 "Import German Equipment"
DKU_Import_German_Equipment_desc:0 "As the victors of the last great war, it stands to reason that German equipment is among the best in the world. Manufacturers of weapons of war like Mauser and Krupp are titans of the arms industry for good reason, as their reputation precedes them. We should reach out to these companies and others like them to import their equipment at once."

DKU_Import_Russian_Equipment:0 "Import Russian Equipment"
DKU_Import_Russian_Equipment_desc:0 "Though they conceded to the Germans in the Weltkrieg, Russian equipment was proven tried and true in the fires of the Russian Civil War. Rapidly making gains in military technology since then, and with their technical know-how and famous manufactures like the Tula Arms Plant behind our war industry, our army shall become as mighty as the Russian Bear."

DKU_Modern_Tactics:0 "Modern Tactics"
DKU_Modern_Tactics_desc:0 "Modern warfare will require modern tactics. We can not win the wars of tomorrow with dead ideas of the past. We must not let the next war devolve into the slogging horror that was the Weltkrieg, so new solutions must be imagined. Without developing modern tactics, we will be consumed by those who surround who have!"

DKU_Produce_More_Equipment:0 "Produce More Equipment"
DKU_Produce_More_Equipment_desc:0 "With our growing armies and our new doctrines developed, the demand for fresh equipment has never been higher. We must expand quotas, build new factories, hire more workers, and anything else we can do to increase our industrial output. Every hand a rifle!"

DKU_Military_Industrial_Complex:0 "Military-Industrial Complex"
DKU_Military_Industrial_Complex_desc:0 "Our private defense industry shall pursue far closer ties with the military and military’s administration in order to smooth cooperation between the two. Like two pieces of the same puzzle, they shall feed off each other, rapidly fueling the rise of our military’s size and strength while also furthering their influence in our government."

DKU_Modernize_Artillery:0 "Modernize Artillery"
DKU_Modernize_Artillery_desc:0 "Modern artillery’s effectiveness has been proven since its inception in the 19th century, being used in every major conflict on Earth since. The next war shall likely be no different, so we must keep pace with the times and our neighbors by modernizing our arsenal at once. Larger and more accurate guns will be needed for the next war so that we may reign fire down upon our potential foes."

DKU_Standartized_Equipment_Production:0 "Standardized Equipment Production"
DKU_Standartized_Equipment_Production_desc:0 "Lighting fast production speeds will be needed if our industry is to keep pace with any future foe. To streamline production and increase outputs, sweeping standardization codes will be drafted, setting official manufacturing guidelines on every piece of equipment we make. All tools and manufacturing equipment will be modified, or if impossible replaced, in order to match the new standards. Though this might slow production down temporarily as factories are refitted, the future benefit to our production speeds will be well worth it."

DKU_Tanks_Of_Don:0 "The Armored Columns of [ROOT.GetAdjective]"
DKU_Tanks_Of_Don_desc:0 "Tanks, while only introduced towards the end of the Weltkrieg, shocked the world with their ingenuity and effectiveness, both as weapons of war and weapons of intimidation. Though the lumbering behemoths of the past will likely not prove effective in future wars, updating and modernizing the concept with the creation of fresh designs might yield success. Using foreign influences, chiefly from Russia and Germany, we shall develop a new line of tanks fitting for our state."

DKU_A_New_Army:0 "A New Army"
DKU_A_New_Army_desc:0 "Our current army is a relic of the past; lying disorganized and outmoded as archaic artefacts of the past. With our new doctrines developed and new equipment being produced, this will all soon change. Even now, the troops are being drilled on how to use their new tools of war and how to understand our new tactics and doctrine. Our new army shall be the pride of the state, serving as sword and shield for the people of our great nation."

DKU_A_Cossack_Airforce:0 "A Cossack Airforce"
DKU_A_Cossack_Airforce_desc:0 "The spirit of the Cossacks shall take wing and fly with the creation of an official, independent airforce for our nation. Previously, what few planes available to our military’s use that wasn't a cargo plane were tied to the army’s beck and call. Though they shall still cooperate, and their Cossack roots will continue to bind them, an independent air force will allow our flyboys a greater degree of freedom in their development."

DKU_Expand_Airfields:0 "Expand Airfields"
DKU_Expand_Airfields_desc:0 "With the advent of air warfare, planes have become increasingly emphasized and utilized by powers around the world as they realized the wide range of potential applications for aircraft. Our state is no different, and in order to better support our burgeoning air force, we shall expand airfields across the nation so that more planes can be stored at the ready and so more pilots can be trained."

DKU_Fighters_For_Don:0 "The Fighter Squadrons of [ROOT.GetAdjective]"
DKU_Fighters_For_Don_desc:0 "Fighter planes first proved their effectiveness in dogfights and anti-bomber missions in the Weltkrieg and the Russian Civil War, capturing the attention of the world with their near-mythic and seemingly death-defying pursuits. With their uses proven on the battlefield, it is almost guaranteed that they will be needed in the next war as well. We shall construct as many as we can, so that we may act as beehive of sorts, releasing a swarm once threatened, blocking out the sun with our wings and drowning out the screams of our enemies with the roar of engines and propellers."

DKU_Bombers_For_Don:0 "The Bomber wings of [ROOT.GetAdjective]"
DKU_Bombers_For_Don_desc:0 "The sheer devastation even a single bomber can unleash was first witnessed in the fires of the Weltkrieg, and their effectiveness has only increased since with better planes and larger bombs. We will double down on their production and fill the skies with our bombers, ready to unleash hell on any who would dare march against us."

DKU_Secure_The_Sky:0 "Secure the Sky"
DKU_Secure_The_Sky_desc:0 "The security of our sovereign airspace must be maintained at all times. If we allow any enemy to achieve aerial superiority over our great state, the results would be catastrophic. This must never be allowed to occur. Anti-air emplacements will spread to dot the nation as a shield against stray foes while our air force shall be the sword, meeting their prey head on in the clouds. The skies of our home shall be ours and ours alone."

DKU_The_Black_Sea_Fleet:0 "The Black Sea Fleet"
DKU_The_Black_Sea_Fleet_desc:0 "The Black Sea serves as our gateway into the wider world and the chief artery of our economy. Without it, our nation would surely collapse. To protect our naval assets and our shores, the Black Sea Fleet must rise, renovated and reformed from the ashes of our current sorry excuse for a naval force. New ships shall be constructed and old ones refitted in our quest to achieve security and perhaps primacy in our home sea."

DKU_Port_Of_Capital:0 "Port Of [ROOT.Capital.GetName]"
DKU_Port_Of_Capital_desc:0 "A new grand port shall be created on the coast of the Black Sea, serving as the center of our new naval expansion and reformation efforts.

DKU_Ukranian_Exercises_desc:0 "Ukraine is one of our closest neighbors and has always served as a major partner in the region, especially when it comes to nautical matters. To further this cooperation, joint naval exercises will be held with the Ukranian Navy to help both of our naval staffs to gain real experience."

DKU_Defend_Coast:0 "Defend Convoys"
DKU_Defend_Coast_desC:0 "Though influential on its waters and important to us, the Black Sea is shared with many other peoples. From rival nations to pirates, these waters are never truly safe. We must ensure the security of our convoys through the application of new patrol routes while also arming the crews of our convoys in case of pirate boardings. Our mercantile fleet must be kept safe, as they are the lifeline of our nation."

DKU_Submarine_Effort:0 "Submarine Effort"
DKU_Submarine_Effort_desc:0 "Submarines shocked the world with their effectiveness in the last great war and ever since, their concept has deeply intrigued our naval staff. With new naval infrastructure in place and new funding allocated to their budget, the Navy has moved to pursue development on our own submarine models. We too shall become wolves of the sea."

DKU_Invest_In_Shipbuilding:0 "Invest In Shipbuilding"
DKU_Invest_In_Shipbuilding_desc:0 "New ships are a necessity for the formation of any great navy, and our state is no exception. New naval infrastructure will be created in order to further speed up shipbuilding efforts, while more dock workers and engineers will be hired to speed up their work. We shall soon have a navy worthy of our proud state!"

DKU_Produce_Cruisers:0 "Produce Cruisers"
DKU_Produce_Cruisers_desc:0 "Cruisers are just about the largest ships our state is capable of manufacturing in any reasonable amount of time while still being able to maintain them post-launch. They serve as fantastic light to medium warships that can fill a variety of roles and, while not as large as the battleships of the Great Powers, they can still outgun or outrun most other vessels they’d come across. With this in mind, our state has gone ahead and okayed a new push on cruiser development and production. They shall serve as the flagships of our new fleet; our powerful Pearls of the Black Sea."

But with the first signs of German economy crumbling, it is a matter of time if the Cossack Republic will continue to exist.

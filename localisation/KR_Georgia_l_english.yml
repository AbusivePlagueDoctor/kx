geo.1.t:0 "Socialist Republic of Georgia"
geo.1.d:0 "The Georgian state was formally established in 1918 after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, and the nation found itself surrounded by the immediate chaos of the Russian Civil War. Georgia quickly became a stronghold for the Menshevik Party, and managed to stay neutral during the Civil War, avoiding confrontation with the White and Red forces. The now ruling Menshevik party banded together with several Bolshevik and Social Revolutionary figures to form a new 'Caucasian' brand of Socialism, which formed a new parliament. Into the 1920's, the country's industrial base developed surprisingly well, however with the integration and subsequent rise of several previously Bolshevik figures, such as Leventi Beria and Ioseb Jughashvili, the Menshevik party was quick to radicalise. The Republic's previously democratic system was slowly dissolving, with the 'Internal Security Service' becoming more involved in Politics. Soon the country's democratic constitution became obsolete, and the power was concentrated in the hands of the Supreme Economic Council, headed by Ioseb Jughashvili. The local peasantry and large aspects of the military have started to become agitated with the increased totalitarianism of the country, and Jughashvili has started to look towards other Caucasus countries to expand. Whatever the future may hold, the future of Georgia is without a doubt uncertain."
geo.1.a:0 "Interesting..."
geo.2.t:0 "Ioseb Jughashvili makes his move"
geo.2.d:0 "After joining the Menshevik party in 1921 and curbing a Bolshevik revolt, Ioseb Jughashvili preceded to rise in the ranks of the Georgian government. In 1931, Jughashvili was appointed General Secretary of the Supreme Economic Council, allowing him to be very influential in the government, pushing for industrialisation and creating an immense bureaucratic administration to control the country whilst promoting fierce Georgian nationalism. By 1936, the Supreme Economic Council that de facto governs the Georgian government is firmly under the control of Jughashvili, and he is in a position to effectively seize control of the government from the current Chairman, Grigol Ordzhonikidze. The Mensheviks control has collapsed and a new era for Georgia is beginning. Georgian Socialism shall shape this nation's future."
geo.2.a:0 "Jughashvili takes full control of the government!"
geo.3.t:0 "Military establishment seized by Beria"
geo.3.d:0 "Many generals within the military still hold loyalty to Grigol Ordzhonikidze’s outdated Menshevik views, despite being loyal to Georgia and her national defence these generals lack eagerness to adopting the ideals of Jughashvili’s Georigan Socialism. Even more surprising is rumours of anti-socialist dissidence. Therefore it has been an immediate priority of Jugashvili to have his comrades seize control of the military hierarchy.\n\n Last night Lavrentiy Beria along with several hundred members of the People's Guard marched into the Georigan Armed Forces headquarters in Tbilsi. Honourable Georigan soldiers upon seeing Beria and his men opened the gates and under the orders of Beria arrested the generals suspected of holding potentially tratorious views. With this issue resolved Chairman Jugashvili plans on promoting Beria to Field Marshal giving him unquestioned control of the military."
geo.3.a:0 "The might of the Georgian military shall guard Ioseb's revolution!"
geo.4.t:0 "People's Guard of Georgia"
geo.4.d:0 "The People’s Guard of Georgia are a nationalist and socialist oriented volunteer force comprised of armed militants whose goal is the defence of the Georgian nation. Led by war hero Valiko Jugheli, the force is numbered around 2,000 active militants with a further 10,000 reserves loyal and ready to take up arms at a moments notice. Officially loyal to the Menshevik government there exists rumours of Jugheli’s true loyalty to Jughashvili and Georgian Socialism, however considering Jughashvilis own loyalty there is no doubt that these comrades will defend the national interests of the Georgian state."
geo.4.a:0 "Brave comrades defend our nation!"
geo.6.t:0 "Chairman Jugashvili Declares the Transcaucasian State!"
geo.6.d:0 "With Armenia and Azerbaijan now firmly under Georgian control, Chairman Jugashivili took to his residence’s balcony onlooking a crowded Jugashvili Square, to announce the formation of the ‘’Great Transcaucasian Socialist State’’. Joined by supervisor Beria, a grand new flag was unveiled that stretched from the balcony to the ground whilst traditional georigna dancers performed the Perkhuli. Cheering crowds welcomed this drastic transformation marking the end of a seperated Caucasus and a new wave of anti-Russian nationalism is expected to sweep the nations as Jugashivili now moves his focus towards the north. Stating in his speech,’’History has shown there are no invincible armies, now we are joined by our Armenian and Azerbaijani comrades there is no force in this world that can stop the might of Transcaucasian Socialism!’’\n\n Already the Don-Kubans are preparing for a defensive war whilst the Ottomans have deployed more troops along their border, it will soon be seen just how far Jugashvili is willing to push his dreams of a strong united Caucasian people."
geo.6.a:0 "Unity at last!"
geo.62.t:0 "Premier Beria Declares the Transcaucasian State!"
geo.62.d:0 "With Armenia and Azerbaijan now firmly under Georgian control, Premier Beria took to his residence’s balcony onlooking a crowded Jugashvili Square, to announce the formation of the ‘’Great Transcaucasian Socialist State’’. Joined by supervisor Goglidze, a grand new flag was unveiled that stretched from the balcony to the ground whilst traditional georigna dancers performed the Perkhuli. Cheering crowds welcomed this drastic transformation marking the end of a seperated Caucasus and a new wave of anti-Russian nationalism is expected to sweep the nations as Jugashivili now moves his focus towards the north. Stating in his speech,’’History has shown there are no invincible armies, now we are joined by our Armenian and Azerbaijani comrades there is no force in this world that can stop the might of Transcaucasian Socialism!’’\n\n Already the Don-Kubans are preparing for a defensive war whilst the Ottomans have deployed more troops along their border, it will soon be seen just how far Beria is willing to push his dreams of a strong united Caucasian people."
geo.62.a:0 "Unity at last!"
geo.7.t:0 "People's Guard face resistance"
geo.7.d:0 "The territories of Armenia and Azerbaijan are now under tight fisted occupation at the behest of Chairman Jugashvili. The People’s Guard has been tasked with restoring order to the chaotic lands wrecked by war, a strenuous task on its own, however the formation of ethnic militancies loyal to the former governments have launched counter insurgencies on newly garrisoned outposts across Transcaucasia. Luckily for the People’s Guard these militants are severely lacking coordination and moral, we shall make quick work of these rebels."
geo.7.a:0 "We shall crush this resistance!"
geo.8.t:0 "Charge of the Cossacks!"
geo.8.d:0 "The proud warrior people of the steppes have long been a pawn to Russian imperialism leaving their homeland, little more than a stepping stone from Russia to Transcaucasia. Georgia remembers when the Cossacks took up arms with both the Whites and Germans, proud puppets to greater powers they were delighted when their masters allowed for the formation of the Don-Kuban Republic. Since then they have threatened the stability of this region with ethnic conflict and encroaching Russian expansion seemingly unnaposed. \n\n As the Cossacks once more charge into battle, sabers raised and horses steady, it will be seen how these archaic warriors of a dead era survive against the crushing tide of modern nationalism and socialism."
geo.8.a:0 "Half a league, half a league, half a league onward...."
geo.9.t:0 "The Orthodox Church of Georgia"
geo.9.d:0 "The Georgian Orthodox Church is an ancient structure that can date itself back to the 5th Century, to the greater populace the teachings of Christ are intrinsically linked to their way of life. Although no longer a religious man, Jugashvili can remember a time when as a young boy he too served the word of Christ. It is because of this that the situation of the Church is one of great sensitivity, whilst it provides unity for the people it also serves as a powerful entity that does not submit itself to the Chairman. Nor does it renounce its communion with other Churches within nations hostile to us. We must decide the fate of the Church, do we maintain its enormous presence in society or listen to the socialist influences of those who oppose it?"
geo.9.a:0 "The church is an integral part of Georgian culture!"
geo.9.b:0 "The church spreads division and false worship, we shall put an end to these oppressors!"
geo.10.t:0 "Persecution of the Orthodox Church"
geo.10.d:0 "Not only does the Catholicos-Patriarch insult the Chairman with his defiance by refusing to cut ties with the Russian Communion, he has the gall to state that his duty to Christ is greater than his duty Georgian Socialism! The Chairman addressed the nation stating, ‘For too long has the church suckled off the teat of the nation! Reaping the rewards earned from the sweat off the worker’s brow! Enough!”\n\nBy Jugashvili’s new orders the church is to confiscate all property to the state, if they do not comply the state shall take it with force. The People’s Guard are prepared to raid churches across the nation, meanwhile in Tiflis and other cities angry crowds of workers defy the word of Christ. Striking priests down and crushing their crosses, Jugashvili is all the matters to them now..."
geo.10.a:0 "The Orthodox Church is antiquated, we shall use its wealth for the state."
geo.11.t:0 "The Menshivik Question"
geo.11.d:0 "When Russia collapsed into civil war the Georgian Menshevik Party quickly took advantage of the power vacuum left and seized control, declaring Georgia an independent nation. The Mensheviks however lacked enough support and power to effectively lead the nation after the civil war, for this reason they entered into an alliance with Bolshevik exiles. Under the new leadership of the former Bolshevik, Sergo Ordzhonikidze, he attempted to appease both factions whilst centralising Georgia as a semi-authoritarian state. Since Jugashvili’s coup Sergo has mostly been sidelined along with many Menshevik figures, although no solid proof of disloyalty exists it is obvious that these politicians wish for revenge.\n\nShould we forge documents and enforce testimonies proving disloyalty or simply have Beria deal with them?"
geo.11.a:0 "Allow for Beria to discretely take care of them..."
geo.11.b:0 "We shall bring them to trial and make a public example out of them."
geo.12.t:0 "Beria's henchmen dispose of Menshivik leadership"
geo.12.d:0 "Beria under direct orders from Chairman Jugashvili had members of the People’s Guard kidnap notable members of the Menshevik Party from their homes in early hours of the morning. Grigol Orzdzhonikidze, Isidore Ramishvili, Noe Ramishvili, Noe Khomeriki and Nikolay Chkheidze were dragged into a secure bunker beneath the streets of Tiflis. Brought before Beria, he charged them all with treason stating to their complete surprise they had attempted a counter-coup to take place. Uncaring to the crying pleas of innocence, Beria ordered his men to line them up against a wall and fill them with lead..."
geo.12.a:0 "A problem no more."
geo.13.t:0 "The Menshivik Trials"
geo.13.d:0 "Grigol Orzdzhonikidze along with important Mensheviks such as Isidore Ramishvili, Noe Ramishvili and Nikolay Chkheidze have been brought in front of the People’s Court. Charged with treason, planning an attempted coup and promoting civil disorder the court has demanded a justifiable defence to be provided by state assigned lawyers. The court has also suggested several punishments to be decided by Jugashvili himself.\n\nGrigol’s defence has claimed that he is a loyal comrade of Jugashvili, stating their extensive friendship since their days as Bolsheviks. He has also claimed that documents detailing a planned coup were forged by Beria, according to the Menshevik defence this whole ordeal has been planned by Beria in an attempt to expand his power. Despite these claims Beria assured the court that his evidence was bullet proof in its authenticity and that statements provided by Sergo should be assumed as false. The court too found the defence questionable, citing eyewitness accounts of Menshevik officials meeting with suspected Russian spies.\n\n After much consideration the court reached the conclusion of guilty for all those accused, they have submitted their justification to Jugahsvili, now it is up to him to decide the defendants’ fate."
geo.13.a:0 "They have provided a satisfactory defence, they will only be removed from government positions and put under house arrest."
geo.13.b:0 "Their defence does not prove them completely innocent of disloyalty, 25 years hard labour!"
geo.13.c:0 "We will not allow for the Menshiviks to make any more claims of innocence, execute them!"
geo.14.t:0 "Russian language banned."
geo.14.d:0 "As part of continuing attempts by the Chairman to decrease outside influence on the nation, the Russian language which has been commonly used throughout Georgia’s history, has been banned. Those found to be speaking Russian in public as well as the distribution of material printed in Russian are to be fined, repeated offenders will be sentenced to forced labour. Meanwhile minority communities are being targeted by state educational forces who have the task of spreading the use of the Georgian language to as many as possible."
geo.14.a:0 "All Russian influence will be crushed!"
geo.150.t:0 "A Show of Strength"
geo.150.d:0 "Luckily Russia is positioned some distance away, the same cannot be said for our enemy in the south. The Ottomans share a direct border with us stretching across the nation’s weakest natural defence. It is only a matter of time before the Ottomans attempt some form of geopolitical aggression in order to tame us. Therefore the Chairman’s advisors have suggested striking first, proving to the Turks that we will not go down without a fight. It is no secret that the empire’s power has declined much since the Weltkrieg.\n\n Either we could launch surprise raids and attacks on Ottoman settlements and convoys to further weaken their position in the region, such attacks would be disguised as random bandit attacks. Or the more extreme option, launch a full invasion of the Lazistan region, home to many ehtnic Georgians likely to support our cause."
geo.150.a:0 "Order the People's Guard to launch an insurgency on the border!"
geo.150.b:0 "The Ottomans are weak! March into Lazistan!"
geo.151.t:0 "People's Guard of Georgia are victorious!"
geo.151.d:0 "Disguised as mercenaries and bandits, People’s Guardsmen attacked settlements and outposts across our southern border. The rapid movement of Guardsmen launching attacks was too much for the stationed Ottoman military causing them to retreat from the region. Such a defeat is shocking for them!"
geo.151.a:0 "A humiliating defeat for the Ottomans."
geo.152.t:0 "Ottomans resist insurgency!"
geo.152.d:0 "The attacks failed! We underestimated the resilience of the Ottomans, despite being caught by surprise and lacking reinforcements they managed to push back our forces and defend the border. Despite no official connections to the government, this defeat of clearly Georgian soldiers has shown great weakness, a weakness the Ottomans are unlikely to forget."
geo.152.a:0 "A definite strike to Jugashivili's ego."
geo.153.t:0 "The Occupation of Lazistan"
geo.153.d:0 "The region of Lazistan is home to a large populace of Georgians, as the Georgian military marched through fallen Ottoman checkpoints they were welcomed by residents loyal to Jugashvili. The strength of our military is superior to that of the Turks, we shall have the entire region under our control in little time."
geo.153.a:0 "We shall resist the vile Turks!"
geo.154.t:0 "Wealth Collection"
geo.154.d:0 "The Supreme Economic Council successfully drafted and passed the, “Reduction of Non-Essential Ownership Law”. This has allowed for the state to collect all private wealth deemed non-essential to the living standard of citizens, this wealth will then be used to fund state projects. Citizens already lost the right to private property and with the law being enforced by the militant People’s Guard it is unlikely that we shall face resistance. More importantly is the decision of where a portion of this new found wealth should go, it would be wise to reward loyal government members however such transfer of money could provide them with more power. On the hand the Chairman could keep it all for himself to ensure the rightful distribution of cash flow."
geo.154.a:0 "The Chairman is most responsible."
geo.154.b:0 "Loyalty has its rewards."
geo.155.t:0 "Cult of Jugashvili"
geo.155.d:0 "The streets of Tiflis were alive with red flags, cheering and the marching of soldiers. Gravitating around an impressive marble statue of the Chairman were hundreds of imposing guardsmen chanting the Georgian national anthem. And from a Tiflis Palace balcony stood Jugashvili, admiring all that he had built. Whilst it seemed that the rest of the world was tearing itself apart, in this moment overlooking his loyal populace naive to global affairs, the Chairman realised how important it was to keep his nation as a fortress. Protected behind unbreakable walls from the rest of the world. His impact on Georgia has transcended into an almost God-like entity, his legions of devout followers worship him as the saviour and defender of their nation."
geo.155.a:0 "Long live the Chairman!"
geo.156.t:0 "All-Georgian Extraordinary Commission"
geo.156.d:0 "The People’s Guard have served valiantly in their effort to defend the motherland, proud nationalists and socialists who have fought and died for the honour of preserving Georgian soil. However despite this their leader, Valiko Jugheli, has been stirring up trouble. Guardsmen have treated the new Premier with distrust and suspicion, despite Jugashvili’s fate being one of obvious misfortune there are those within the Guard who put the blame on Beria.\n\nTo bring order back to the Guard, Premier Beria has decided a restructuring is best, now under the leadership of loyalist and personal friend to Beria, Sergo Goglidze. The People’s Guard has been renamed to the, All-Georgian Extraordinary Commission, or as it is more commonly known the ‘Cheka’. The tasks of the Cheka are to investigate and root out any political opponents through secret arrests, executions and torture, Chekist officers are also to police and run the rapidly expanding Gulag system that is being built across the nation. As for its former leader, Jugheli, his current whereabouts are unknown and there are rumours of his death but also of self imposed exile..."
geo.156.a:0 "The torch is passed..."
geo.157.t:0 "If you go out into the woods today..."
geo.157.d:0 "The job of the Chairman can be extraordinarily stressful, therefore Jugashvili enjoys spending what free time he has at his multiple dachas. One such includes plentiful land used by Jugashvili and his comrades for hunting game, and this day was meant to be just like any other hunt. Armed with his hunting rifle he set off with his hunting comrades, mostly SEC officials, in search for Caspian red deer.\n\nTrudging through dense woodland, Jugashvili was eager for something to shoot, recent dealings with party officials had left him with a painful headache, he needed to clear his mind before returning to Tiflis. As he looked around he noticed a strange occurrence, his bodyguards who usually surround him at all times were distancing themselves from him whilst his hunting comrades were grouped together some meters away from him. He turned his head to inspect his rifle when the sounds of snapping branches caught him off guard, his party had seemingly vanished leaving him alone surrounded by imposing trees. Then without warning a ferocious roar struck eardrums like bullets, a behemoth of mountain bear came charging towards him. Before he could react the bear had struck him down, its clears ready to slash his feeble body apart. Mustering his remaining strength, Jugashvili cried for help..."
geo.157.a:0 "...his bodyguards then appear firing at the bear wounding it before it could kill him!"
geo.157.b:0 "his bodyguards are too late! The Chairman's corpse lays torn apart..."
geo.158.t:0 "The Chairman Recovers from the Attack"
geo.158.d:0 "Jugashvili’s roars of pain as his face was slashed altered his bodyguards who immediately charged through the woods in search of their Chairman, they spotted him on the ground as the mountain bear towered above him. Unleashing a volley of fire the Bear was struck down, its last whimpers ended with a bullet to the head. The Chairman was immediately rushed to the nearest hospital where he is now under intensive care. Recovering from his wounds the nation were relieved that their dear leader lives to fight another day, however despite the good news there remain some serious questions. Why did his hunting comrades flee before a bear had even been spotted? Why were his bodyguards stationed so far away from the hunting grounds? What was a wandering mountain bear doing on his land? An almost deadly attack from a crazed bear or perhaps something more sinister…."
geo.158.a:0 "Rest well Chairman."
geo.159.t:0 "The Chairman Is Dead!"
geo.159.d:0 "‘The Chairman is dead!’, these were the lines that sent shockwaves throughout the nation. Jugashvili was not only a dear leader of Georgia but he was seen as the national father for every citizen, the defender of the republic. His death was initially suppressed by the SEC, news of his passing was a well guarded secret however it was a secret that could not last long. Jugashvili had passed away from his many wounds suffered during the hunting incident, his bodyguards arriving too late to save his life as the mountain bear charged off hearing a volley of fire. There is much suspicion around the event due Jugashvili’s bodyguards not being present and the time it took for the mortally wounded Chairman to arrive at a hospital, Beria however has confirmed his passing was nothing more than a tragic attack. Whilst delivering his speech at the state funeral, Beria confirmed what was already widely expected, he will succeed the deceased chairman as head of state."
geo.159.a:0 "How could this happen!"
geo.160.t:0 "The New Premier"
geo.160.d:0 "Following the catastrophic hunting accident that has left our dear Chairman deceased, his successor Lavrentiy Beria has been elected by the SEC to assume the position of both head of state and head of government. Adopting the title of ‘Premier’ and adorned in his all black uniform, Beria took to the stage addressing his fellow SEC members. Promising to continue the legacy of Jugashvili through the dedication to Georgian Socialism and achieve the goal of prosperity for every Georgian citizen. However, Beria also stated his intention to introduce economic reforms that could solve the recent slump as well as re-organising the People’s Guard and SEC structure.\n\nFor those wary of Jugashvili’s temper, Beria’s calm and calculated deminier only provides so much relief for it was Beria who organised the purge of the Mensheviks. The fate of Grigol and his comrades could very well await many within the SEC chamber applauding the new Premier. There is also suspicion over the actual fate of the former Chairman, with some doubting the validity of the ‘hunting accident’. Such preposterous rumours will surely be shut down by Beria..."
geo.160.a:0 "Long live Premier Beria!"
geo.161.t:0 "The Night in Tiflis"
geo.161.d:0 "Ever since Lavrentiy took power in Georgia and slowly liberalized the Government to allow some private wealth in the name of 'Progressive Georgian Socialism', he has long since felt the strumming wealth dripping from the pockets of billionaires right to Beria's pockets. Lavrentiy has since then created lavish parties which are unprecedented in scale in the humble nation of Georgia. Despite the enormous size of these parties, the cost to the Government has not been unreasonable, and Beria has tried to maintain a little bit of restraint regarding them. This time, he has created an entire statue made out of ice of himself, commissioned to the best artists in Georgia and used it to make a fruity beverage with crushed ice and fruit juice. Of course, the fruits came from the best sellers in the market across the Caucasus, and only the best friends of Beria were invited. The cause of the party was to 'Celebrate the Party with a party'."
geo.161.a:0 "Let us indulge ourselves for once!"
geo.162.t:0 "Sins of the Premier"
geo.162.d:0 "It appears that Beria has decided that for Georgia to thrive as a nation, it requires profiting - and so, he has done efforts to contact as many people as possible, as many corporations as possible, and as many organizations as possible, to secure as much money as possible for the State of Georgia. This includes the selling of weapons to militant groups in the Russian Tsaritsiyn area, and helping Armenian groups in the Ottoman Empire to rise in resistance in the mountains against the ruling Ottoman Government in favor of creating an expanded Armenian State. Beria has also used the labor of prisoners and political opponents across the world to create a massive slave labour army, used to create grand construction projects for the Georgian people. Not only this, but we've also done efforts in creating trafficking lines of human beings across the Kuban area, everything from children to poor women to the mentally ill are brought in coal trains and forced to do whatever their purchasers wish. Beria in particular has seen human trafficking as one of the best parts of the Georgian economy, wanting to buy a harem of women for himself aswell. This would be risky however, and might result in people finding out and the nescessity of further purges in our society. Beria is at a crossroads - pleasure, or security?"
geo.162.a:0 "For pleasure..."
geo.162.b:0 "For security..."
geo.163.t:0 "The Secret Speech"
geo.163.d:0 "Beria was quick to get to the point - he stood up in a podium in front of hundreds of people, and began his speech with a meek but steady voice:\n\n'Comrades! It is clear to me that you all have suffered for far too long under the Great Terror of Jugashvili and his horrific practices against humanity. He has, for over two years, held all of you in horror and fear, in constant sensation of terrorization and a feeling that you might not live the next day. No longer - For after his hunting accident, I realized I must strike the opportunity and liberate the peoples of Georgia from excess tyranny and lack of reasonable rule, and ensure that we as a Party are united and without fear of sectarianism and splitting. We are united under socialism, and we believe in a bright future for Georgia at costs, but not costs that will destroy our people and tear them apart in sectarian lines. I proclaim: You are free! You are free from his grasp, from his terroristic gaze! The Man of Steel has fallen, and I have risen.'"
geo.163.a:0 "Silence dominates the chamber..."
geo.165.t:0 "Beria Invokes The SEC"
geo.165.d:0 "Our Premier, Lavrentiy Beria, has requested that all SEC members come to an immediate and urgent meeting as soon as possible or face expropriation of their property to the State. It appears that this is serious as Beria has only invoked the entire Party to convene once."
geo.165.a:0 "Well, better meet him then!"
geo.166.t:0 "The Reaction"
geo.166.d:0 "Immediately some loyalists of Jugashvili collapsed, began shouting, or began fighting with others that cheered on. The crowd fell into anarchy as some cried in animalistic rage as they realized that it was over, like an abuser gone after many years of a horrifying relationship, and others had blank reactions, unsure how to exactly feel. The entire Party was shocked, and could not believe what was heard. The majority however somewhat supported Beria, seeing him as a more moderate force that could protect Georgia from further terror, while some loyalists still afraid that this might be a trick (as paranoia was rampant) stated that they would always be loyal to the Party. Most people were in complete horror - and now, Tiflis is filled with newspapers with the full transcription of the Speech, resulting in even more shocked peasants and people all around Georgia that react in either joy or terror. It appears that this might go on for a while..."
geo.166.a:0 "The truth often hurts."
geo.164.t:0 "The Chambers of Knowledge"
geo.164.d:0 "Beria has done extensive efforts regarding the progress of military equipment to compete against other nations. With the newfound wealth gained from opening the Georgian market economy, Beria has created testing chambers to test new chemical weapons, missiles, and other equipment that is considered by the State too confidential to be placing on public testing grounds, so instead they are placed on the Chambers of Knowledge, as they are cryptically called by the Government, placed all around the countryside in Georgia. Of course, to test these new weapons, which range from everything from cyanide caapsules to botulimnium bullets, he has to bring... "willing" subjects to the table. Therefore, the lowest of the lowest in Georgian society are brought to the operating table and tested on, ensuring that nobody but criminals, political enemies, and enemies in other countries during war feel the effects of these new advancements in technology. Beria has personally visited many of these Chambers of Knowledge, recording much of the situations present within them for later study."
geo.165.a:0 "Taming the Cossaks..."
geo.165.t:0 "The Chambers of Knowledge"
geo.165.d:0 "After an intense war with the Don Kuban Union, we have successfully captured the capital of Ekaterinodar and pushed the resisting army to the Russian border. Although we are far from implementing rule over the entire nation, we do possess power over the majority of Don-Kuban citizens. Rebels are hidden throughout the mountains and the war will now evolve into guerrilla warfare that will undoubtedly create great pain for us. In the meantime let us celebrate our victory!"
geo.165.a:0 "No force can stop us!"
geo.170.t:0 "Georgia in the Internationale?"
geo.170.d:0 "[GEO.GetNameDEF] has been one of our closest allies in Eastern Europe after their revolution, and they have now sent a request to formally join the Third Internationale. However if we are to accept we will most likely face conflict with Russia."
geo.170.a:0 "Let them in, damn the Russians."
geo.170.b:0 "Georgia is not worth conflict with Russia."
geo.171.t:0 "The French Refuse!"
geo.171.d:0 "After our diplomats were sent to Paris to convince the French to let us join the Third Internationale, it seems that we were denied our request, as such we are now alone in Europe against Russian imperialism and we've been forced down an isolationist path."
geo.171.a:0 "The French will pay for this betrayal!"
geo.172.t:0 "Court of the Red Premier"
geo.172.d:0 "Beria's new secretary sauntered into the room, holding a wad of documents to her chest. Beria gave a lecherous smile and rose to his feet and greeted her. She returned an almost mocking salute.\n\n"Here are the reports, my Premier," Anastasia smiled, placing them onto his desk with a flick of her brown hair. Beria grabbed her by the waist.\n\n"I'm too busy to get up to anything too shocking today, I'm afraid," he said with a wink, filling her nostrils with the scent of cigar smoke and vodka. "I'm passing a new law to get us married." Seeing the shock on her face made him laugh. "You and all those actresses I told you about. Did I mention the one I fucked last week? She resisted to start with, but my seductions never fail. You can't say no to the Premier... "\n\n"Marriage..." She was still confused.\n\n"I'm legalizing polygamy as of today. And why not? It's within man's nature to spread his seed and bolster his race, after all. Monogamous marriages are Christian nonsense, a bourgeois attempt to prevent the growth of socialist demographics!" He didn't mention the reports detailing the public's alleged 'disgust' of such a concept. The reports weren't relevant, or true.\n\n"Do you really want to marry me," Anastasia replied. "None of my friends are married, and they're also eighteen–"\n\n"Of course I don't," Beria snapped, furious at her continued reluctance. "I've changed my mind. Get on the desk. That's all you're good for.""
geo.172.a:0 "The Premier's desires are once more fulfilled..."

GEO_eco_idea_desc:0 "The Supreme Economic Council is composed of former Bolsheviks who have been trusted with the task of guiding the economy.

### Focuses ###

georgian_socialism_focus:0 "Georgian Socialism"
georgian_socialism_focus_desc:0 "Strength, hard-work and patriotic duty will define this nation. No longer restrained by the shackles of a fractured backwards nation, only the limits of comrade loyalty can stop Georgian Socialism!"
peoples_guard_focus:0 "Power to the People's Guard"
peoples_guard_focus_desc:0 "Established to defend the Georgian nation, the People’s Guard have served bravely against outside aggressors whilst promoting the socialist-nationalist spirit shared by our Chairman. We shall use these warriors in the defence of the motherland."
beria_focus:0 "Beria's Ambitions"
beria_focus_desc:0 "Comrade Lavrentiy Beria has proven crucial in securing Jugashvili’s power over the nation, his crackdowns on potential counter-revolutionaries and harsh punishments for those unwilling to carry out his orders have forged Beria’s public image of a loyal servant to the Chairman. Surely he can be trusted to take full direction over counter-revolutionary tasks..."
mountain_gulags_focus:0 "Mountain Gulags"
mountain_gulags_focus_desc:0 "The grand Caucasus Mountain range provides an impenetrable fortress of nature, conquered and tamed only by the strength of the Georgian people. Comrade Beria has devised an excellent plan to make use of this, construction of labour camps that will house enemies of the state. There shall be no escape from these mountain gulags."
loyal_workers_focus:0 "Loyal Workers Make Loyal Soldiers"
loyal_workers_focus_desc:0 "State funded propaganda in the workplace will be introduced, across the nation within government owned steelworks, coal mines, lumber mills, factories and collective farms the message of Georgian Socialism will be stronger than ever! It will be the duty of political commissars to ensure that loyal workers shall adore the chairman, that they be prepared to fight to the last man in the defence of the motherland!"
tower_focus:0 "Tower of Tiflis"
tower_focus_desc:0 "Representing the future, a tower of industrial modernisation standing strong. In recent years Tiflis has undergone a dramatic change, becoming a hub for industry, trade and commerce. From this capital, the nation can exert its political influence however the potential of Georgia can only be unlocked if the rest of the nation follows in suit."
end_mensheviks_focus:0 "End Moderate Menshevism"
end_mensheviks_focus_desc:0 "The Mensheviks, thanks to exiled Bolshevik influence, have done a commendable job at maintaining the Georgian state. However they lack the willingness to further push for Georgia to be reborn as the dominant nation in the region. Their moderate views may provide an obstacle for Jugashvili’s policies..."
class_conflict:0 "Class Warfare"
class_conflict_desc:0 "Feudal society has still had a firm grip over Georgia despite the rest of the world modernizing, this created a stark division between landowners and labourers. It is time for the workers of the nation to strike back, the state will glorify class combat and promote the elevation of the poor in society."
enforce_wealth_focus:0 "Enforce Wealth Distribution"
enforce_wealth_focus_desc:0 "The living standard of classes divides the nation, the wealthy elite enjoy a refined life whilst the rural peasant slaves away to earn a basic living. The Chairman is the caring father of the nation, all citizens are equal and with the state’s confiscation of excessive private wealth all citizens will live at the same standard. True equality!"
loyalty_focus:0 "Loyalty or Fear?"
loyalty_focus_desc:0 "Workers, soldiers, government officials, all pledge their undying allegiance to Jugashvili. Is it through love of the Chairman? Or perhaps the result of our successful show of force? The answer is irrelevant for it is undeniable that the Chairman’s strength and power is unquestionable."
collectivise_farms_focus:0 "Collectivise the Farms"
collectivise_farms_focus_desc:0 "Farming is mostly performed through archaic means, the growing populace requires more food which requires a new way of farming. By collectivising formerly privately owned farms and running these farms as factories with an increased number of farmers given specific tasks we can greatly increase yields."
industry_focus:0 "Industrialize the Countryside"
industry_focus_desc:0 "The wonders of machinery unlock unlimited potential for Georgia’s production ability, it is time to expand the factories out of the cities, and into the vast swathes of rural land. The wilderness will be tamed, mother nature shall answer to the Chairman."
expand_state_focus:0 "Expanding the State's Capabilities"
expand_state_focus_desc:0 "All efforts will be put into the persument of scientific advancement, we are a backwards people no more. By providing more power to the intelligence agency under Comrade Beria’s supervision we can unlock greater means of domination."
resist_russia_focus:0 "Resist Russian Influence"
resist_russia_focus_desc:0 "Linguistics are more than the spoken tongue, through linguistics a nation can exert power over other nations. The cultural influence of Russia through the Russian language is a remnant of imperialistic control, we must smash this oppression!"
georgian_culture_focus:0 "Promoting Georgian Culture"
georgian_culture_focus_desc:0 "Banning the Russian language was only the first step to uniting the nation, the beauties of Georgian culture must be promoted and enforced upon all. Ethnic minorities have for too long insulted our nation through practicing their opposing culture, instead we shall educate them on Georgian values and way of living."
georgian_strength_focus:0 "Caucasian Strength"
georgian_strength_focus_desc:0 "Our people have been moulded by the harsh environment, strengthened by a history of oppression under the Tsardom and born anew through the birth of the Georgian Socialist State. No other peoples share our strength and determination, no other peoples equal our resistance. We are the superior masters of the Caucasus!"
no_nation_focus:0 "We Kneel To No Other Nation"
no_nation_focus_desc:0 "The Anti-Russian cultural campaign has succeeded in fighting off Russian influence however we are still susceptible to outside domination if we do not take direct action. The Ottoman Empire has long tried to shape our politics in their favour, we need to send out a clear message. Georgia kneels to no other nation."
chairman_focus:0 "Jugashvili Is Georgia!"
chairman_focus_desc:0 "The Chairman’s love for Georgia knows no bounds, he will sacrifice anything to assure that the Georgian people are free from all forms of tyranny and oppression. And in turn the Georgian people truly love their Chairman. The nation has evolved into Jugashvili’s idealised society. Jugashvili is Georgia."

beria_control:0 "Dictated by the Shadows"
beria_control_desc:0 "Beria’s grip over the nation has always been from behind the veiled curtain, preferring to serve in the shadow of Jugashvili has allowed him to operate without being questioned for his morally dubious actions. Now with Jugashvili dead he has been thrusted into the public view, the Premier must lead Georgia forward through these difficult times..."
beria_economy:0 "State Guided Market Socialism"
beria_economy_desc:0 "Although Jugashvili’s centralisation of the economy and colleviticsation of industries has brought temporary stability it is clear that the economy is in a slump. Therefore the Premier has decided to adopt some liberalisation to the economy in the hopes of increasing profits for the state."
beria_liberty:0 "Progress Over Morality"
beria_liberty_desc:0 "Concepts such as morality and ‘human rights’ were purely created to stifle the advancement of the human race. We have so much untapped scientific potential, potential to dominate the battleground. However, this can only be achieved through the use of testing on humans. Then we can fully understand the effects of chemical warfare and advanced weaponry!"
beria_gamer:0 "Oppress the Ethnic Minorities"
beria_gamer_desc:0 "Despite the efforts of Jugashvili to cease ethnic tensions there is much conflict, there stronger action is necessary. The adoption of Georgian culture is clearly not possible for such inferior peoples, therefore we shall limit the amount of children that minorities can produce and actively promote the superiority of Georgian genetics."
beria_labour:0 "Authorise Slave Labour"
beria_labour_desc:0 "The Premier has grand visions for Georgia, visions that can only possible with an enhanced labour force. Society’s ‘undesirables’ such as criminals, political prisoners, ethnic minorities, unemployed, the homeless and even orphans will be used for slave labour to construct our industrial future."
beria_desires:0 "Satisfy the Premier's Desires"
beria_desires_desc:0 "Beria is a man of certain... interests, his shameful private life was previously a well kept secret from Jugashvili and the rest of the SEC. However, now with full power in his hands the Premier may entertain his darkest vices, unquestioned and unopposed."
beria_gulag:0 "One Large Gulag"
beria_gulag_desc:0 "Garrisoned bunkers dominate the landscape, labourers toil against their will to construct imposing factories and military outposts, the Cheka patrol the streets of the nation like prison guards. Beria has forged Georgia into a rigorous and well run labour camp, one that spans across cities, mountains and farmland."
beria_purge_ranks:0 "Cull the Herd"
beria_purge_ranks_desc:0 "The sudden change in leadership has not gone as smoothly as expected, despite Jugashvili’s death being nothing more than a tragic accident there are those who question the government’s statements. It is time to dispose of those who question the legitimate successor to the deceased Chairman."
beria_fight_cult:0 "Abolish the Cult of Personality"
beria_fight_cult_desc:0 "Power is only possible if those around you cooperate, whether it be willing or at the barrel of a gun. Beria whilst a man of cruelty is also a man of politics. Jugashvili made many enemies through his purges and repression, it will be useful to court these former enemies and also tarnish the legacy of Beria’s deceased rival..."

defend_motherland_focus:0 "Defending the Motherland"
defend_motherland_focus_desc:0 "Jugashivili's dream can only be achieved if the nation is prepared to defend itself. The Don-Kubans and Russians in the North and Ottomans in the South pose dangerous threats whilst the Armenians and Azerbjianis hold enemy governments, surrounded by enemies we must be ready for anything."
expand_motherland_focus:0 "Expanding the Motherland"
expand_motherland_focus_desc:0 "The best defence is a good offence, therefore the Georgian military must be ready to launch offensive wars in the name of defending the national interests of Georiga."
armenia_focus:0 "Armenia? Never Heard of It..."
armenia_focus_desc:0 "The regime in Yerevan harbours great hostility towards Georgian Socialism and the Chairman. With Georgia’s superior military there is no reason not to invade."
azer_focus:0 "Seize Azerbaijani Resources"
azer_focus_desc:0 "The Baku Oil Fields posses abundant wealth and influence over the entirety of the Caucasus region and beyond. It is in our best interest to launch a surprise offensive on the unsuspecting Azerbaijanis."
uniting_the_people_focus:0 "Uniting the People"
uniting_the_people_focus_desc:0 "With the Armenian and Azerbaijani populaces now under Goergian control the state must undergo the integration and unification of these people. Ethnic and cultural resistance must be crushed before a united state can be formed "
trans_state_focus:0 "Transcaucasian Union"
trans_state_focus_desc:0 "From Tbilisi to Baku the flag of Transcaucasia hangs high signaling the new era that dawns on the people of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. This union will be formalised through the creation of the Great Transcaucasian Socialist State."
don_kuban_focus:0 "Strike the Don-Kuban Union!"
don_kuban_focus_desc:0 "The Don-Kubans are weak and unable to efficiently govern their land and therefore we must strike before the Russians inevitably sweep through Ciscaucasia!"
GEO_join_internationale:0 "Join the Internationale"
GEO_join_internationale_desc:0 "The time has come where we must honour our international obligations and support the revolution abroad, and join the French on their journey to liberate the workers of Europe."
GEO_isolation:0 "Totalist Isolation"
GEO_isolation_desc:0 "Georgia needs not for international alliances, we have survived without the influence of other nations for years and must continue to do so."


GEO_army_effort:0 "Georgian Army"
GEO_army_effort_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg, from its start to its end, changed warfare forever by finally ending Napoleonic Warfare's grasp on military thought and confirming the extreme deadliness of the rifle, machine gun and artillery cannon. Our army must adapt or perish, in a literal sense."
GEO_equipment_effort:0 "Equipment Modernisation"
GEO_equipment_effort_desc:0 "For a long time, military breakthroughs were slow, and having a good bolt-action rifle was enough. However, these rifles of the 19th Century are completely out of place on post-Weltkrieg battlefield. We must stop being complacent and get new equipment."
GEO_motorization_effort:0 "Army Motorisation"
GEO_motorization_effort_desc:0 "The cavalry charges of the Weltkrieg were probably the last. The truck is no longer just a transport tool and rapidly integrates to mobile warfare tactics. We must shake off outdated thinking and use motorisation to speed up our offensives and reinforcements."
GEO_doctrine_effort:0 "Studying the Weltkrieg"
GEO_doctrine_effort_desc:0 "We know about the Weltkrieg, but what have we learned from it? In just five years of conflict, countless soldiers died to teach us the new dynamics of warfare. If we do not learn about them, then our soldiers will meet the same fate on the battlefield."
GEO_equipment_effort_2:0 "Equipment Research"
GEO_equipment_effort_2_desc:0 "We might have caught up to modern equipment, but new designs are already making ours obsolete. Regardless, we must persevere, and make sure that we never fall a single year behind in equipment. This means we will have to start developing our own designs."
GEO_mechanization_effort:0 "Mechanised Warfare"
GEO_mechanization_effort_desc:0 "Trucks fared poorly on the frontlines, but it seems that we can now meet halfway between trucks and tanks. Armoured personal carriers can bring troops directly into combat, shield them from fire, and even provide powerful fire support if needed."
GEO_doctrine_effort_2:0 "Military Exercises"
GEO_doctrine_effort_2_desc:0 "Every great power exercises, and so should we. War games are more than peacetime entertainment for generals, they allow us to test both true and tested and revolutionary tactics without wasting countless lives. This allows us to complete our theoretical discoveries."
GEO_equipment_effort_3:0 "Equipment Breakthroughs"
GEO_equipment_effort_3_desc:0 "We have come to such an experience in equipment research that we are no longer limited to eternally catching up or buying foreign equipment to get cutting-edge military gear. Even great powers may soon be surprised by what will soon be in our soldiers' hands."
GEO_armor_effort:0 "Armoured Warfare"
GEO_armor_effort_desc:0 "Tanks are the pinnacle of modern warfare. Mobile vehicles armed with cannons worthy of artillery, and impervious to the average rifle. Even if we only produce few, we will plow through our enemies with judicious use of those steel behemoths."
GEO_special_forces:0 "Special Forces"
GEO_special_forces_desc:0 "Special Forces are more than the Elite Units of old. With modern equipment, even a conscript can hold his own on the battlefield. However, some situations are so hostile that they need specially trained men. Mountain ranges, amphibious landings, airborne assaults."

GEO_aviation_effort:0 "Georgian Air Force"
GEO_aviation_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YAir Base§!"
GEO_aviation_effort_desc:0 "The field of aviation was born almost in time for the Weltkrieg. Even two decades after this war, it is still new, and all nations strive to be ready for the next time their planes may be called to war. We must, too. We must found a solid Air Force to organise them."
GEO_fighter_focus:0 "Air Superiority"
GEO_fighter_focus_desc:0 "The dogfights of the Weltkrieg were merely the start of air-to-air warfare. As planes become faster, more armoured and more heavily armed, we need to put all our efforts into making sure we control the air. Then, striking the ground is a formality."
GEO_bomber_focus:0 "Strategic Bombing"
GEO_bomber_focus_desc:0 "Even when they were brand new, bombers inspired fear, and many saw their potential. As payloads get larger and bigger, even the artillery barrages of the Weltkrieg fail to compare. Some day, we may even surpass them, and destroy entire cities or regions in one run."
GEO_aviation_effort_2:0 "Modern Air Tactics"
GEO_aviation_effort_2_desc:0 "Planes have long stopped being just reconnaissance and harassment tools. By integrating them fully into our army operations, the air force is capable of dealing as much damage and advancing our operations as much as the average Army Command."
GEO_CAS_effort:0 "Close Air Support"
GEO_CAS_effort_desc:0 "While Fighters and Bombers can indirectly affect the battle, dedicated CAS planes have both the agility and armament needed to perform strafe and bombing runs on ground targets, causing major damage on unprepared armies while handling decently in aerial combat."
GEO_rocket_effort:0 "Experimental Rocketry"
GEO_rocket_effort_desc:0 "The field of rocketry is perhaps one of the newest fields of military science. If our scientists are to be believed, rocket engines can achieve speeds that would put radial engines to shame. Some say they could go even faster than sound, certainly extremely exciting."
GEO_NAV_effort:0 "Naval Aviation"
GEO_NAV_effort_desc:0 "Perhaps one of the major breakthroughs in naval warfare, naval bombers are able to lay waste on enemy fleets with torpedoes and other dedicated naval payloads like mines. Supporting our fleets, they can challenge capital ships and wreck havoc in the naval screens."

GEO_naval_effort:0 "Georgian Navy"
GEO_naval_effort_tt:0 "Not enough building slots for §YNaval Dockyards§!"
GEO_naval_effort_desc:0 "If we are to establish a strong navy, we need to produce it first. Shipbuilding methods have evolved, and old drydocks need to be upgraded as much as new dockyards must be built from scratch. The modern ship is no cog, and we must see big to have a sea-worthy fleet."
GEO_flexible_navy:0 "Flexible Tactics"
GEO_flexible_navy_desc:0 "We will never have the navies of the world powers, able to clean entire seas of opposition, but this does not mean our fleet will hide in port. Using flexible tactics and modern inventions like submarines, we do not need to actually match up with those grand fleets to wreck havoc."
GEO_large_navy:0 "Power Projection"
GEO_large_navy_desc:0 "Our navy might not yet be able to contest the bigger navies of this world, but by picking our fights smartly and keeping our fleets focused, we can make sure that any confrontation is in our advantage while still retaining a powerful navy that can rout weaker navies."
GEO_submarine_effort:0 "Submarine Warfare"
GEO_submarine_effort_desc:0 "Submarine warfare is the most exciting naval development since the invention of the torpedo boat, and challenges even the most classical doctrines of naval warfare. We would do well to not just protect against submarines, but also use them against enemy ships."
GEO_cruiser_effort:0 "Screen Ships"
GEO_cruiser_effort_desc:0 "Cruisers are not just 'cheap Battleships', and such outdated thinking ruins the potential of those ships. We should use them as escorts to our capital ships, as they are very vulnerable to naval bombers and smaller ships like torpedo boats."
GEO_destroyer_effort:0 "Anti-Submarine Warfare"
GEO_destroyer_effort_desc:0 "By studying the design and strategic use of submarines, we also learn how to counter them. Our Destroyers will need specialised equipment like depth charges and specific designs that are both light and small to ensure they can escort convoys and patrol efficiently."
GEO_capital_ships_effort:0 "Capital Ships"
GEO_capital_ships_effort_desc:0 "Eventually, a fleet is nothing without a centrepiece, and both the old Battleship and modern Carrier fit this role. While vulnerable in a direct confrontation, they can bring massive damage upon enemy fleets if we let them shell and swarm the enemy ships from a safe distance."

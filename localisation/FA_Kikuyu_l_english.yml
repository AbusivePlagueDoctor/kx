KIK_onlyobama_desc:0 "It is now clear to all within our beloved Kenya, and soon it will be clear to all of Africa.

KIK_onlytotalism_desc:0 "Totalism, the most powerful and sole accpectable idea of the White Man, is the only way that we can free Africa.

### Leader Bios ###

POLITICS_OBAMA_DESC:0 "For 11 years the Mau-Mau have resisted for forces of Kenya-Uganda. At the head of the resistance is a man by the name of Hussein Onyango Obama, the sole salvation of Kenya against imperialist forces. Even though times may seem bleak, the African Liberation Army holds strong, and will do so until the bitter end. Until the end comes, Obama will lead the Mau-Mau against all forces of imperialism, whether they be the Germans or the perfidious Syndicalists based in London or Paris. Obama’s Socialism is not one crafted in the halls of European Elites, but in the heart of Africa. To the enemies of Obama, to the enemies of the People of Africa; no mercy will be shown, no concessions given, and no surrender accepted."

POLITICS_PUNISHED_OBAMA_DESC:0 "After the disastrous climax of the Mau-Mau’s initial revolution, our forces were scattered and slaughtered, mercilessly gunned down by the frontier forces of Kenya-Uganda. Hussein Onyago Obama himself was thought to be dead, with his closest associates fleeing into hiding under the command of his right hand man Dedan Kimathi, who has also made sure to save Obama’s only son. What no one knew, however, was that Obama had miraculously survived the battle! Crawling dozens of miles to the nearest safe village while clutching his bleeding gunshot and sabre wounds, he limped painfully to safety. Once in the care of local sympathizers, he would plot his revenge as the tribal healers tended to his wounds that would horrifically scar his body for life. Awaiting the perfect day to reveal his survival to his people, the collapse of the bloated Mittelafrikan monstrosity has provided the perfect stage for his return. Once again, Obama marches towards his destiny, seemingly back from the dead, infuriated and more determined than ever before. For the people of Africa, for Totalism, only Obama can be their true salvation."
### Focuses ###

KIK_mau_mau_bush_war:0 "The Bush War Continues"
KIK_mau_mau_bush_war_desc:0 "For 11 years we have fought and bled to free Kenya. With the dawn of 1936, Obama is determined that this will be the last year of the Bush War. We will either be victorious or not be at all."
KIK_resistance_to_the_end:0 "Resistance to the Bitter End"
KIK_resistance_to_the_end_desc:0 "Even though Obama has promised that we shall finally come to victory, in the impossible scenario that we do lose, Obama has instated a backup plan known as the resistance to the end plan. With this plan, we will never be able to taste defeat even if we lose the coming great battle!"
KIK_call_to_arms:0 "A Call to Rebellion"
KIK_call_to_arms_desc:0 "As we prepare for the final battle, we are going to need more men. To this end, Obama has green lit a great propaganda campaign across Kenya. Obama himself is set to give a great radio speech, one that shall be heard all around Kenya. Furthermore, a series of covert poster drops shall be made. By the time we are done, all Kenyans shall know the time is coming, the Light of Obama shall soon engulf all of Kenya!"
KIK_arms_trade:0 "Blood and Bullets"
KIK_arms_trade_desc:0 "As the final battle approaches ever quicker, we require arms. It is no secret that the Mau-Mau are using highly outdated equipment. It is also no secret that we are quickly running out of bullets. In order to solve this, Obama has agreed to an offer from a mercenary company based out of the Congo. They will provide us with modern equipment. In exchange, we are to take out a few “problem” colonial administrators for them. While some may scoff at this, once they learn the Great Obama is the one who took the deal, they will quickly be silenced."
KIK_fortify_the_mountain:0 "The Mountain's Final Test"
KIK_fortify_the_mountain_desc:0 "Mt. Kenya, the great symbol of both our revolt and people, is a very powerful and moving image to the minds of the Mau-Mau. For us, it shows that while oppression may come, it can never fully destroy a people. The Mountain has been here from the beginning, and will be, until the end. The Mountain is also symbolic of the Great Mountain of the Mau-Mau, Obama. Obama stands above us all, guiding us, as a lighthouse guides ships at sea. Just as ship at sea when the lighthouse goes out crashes against the rocks of the shore, so too will the Mau-Mau crash without the guidance of Obama. This coming battle will be a great test for the Mountain of the Mau-Mau, but with the love of the people and the unity of Totalism, there is no way the Mountain will not be able to stand firm in the coming storm."
KIK_only_obama:0 "Only Obama..."
KIK_only_obama_desc:0 "Obama. The very mention of His name causes our enemies to cringe in fear, as they should. Obama the Great, leader of the Mau-Mau, is the sole hope of Afrika. It is Only Obama, with a wisdom far surpassing that of King Solomon, who can free not just Kenya, but all of Afrika. Only Obama can lead us, the Mau-Maus of the ALA, to victory. Long Live Obama! "
KIK_only_totalism:0 "Only Totalism..."
KIK_only_totalism_desc:0 "Totalism: an ideology born not in the halls of some European College, but in the hearts of men who saw the corruption and vanity of Syndicalism and Radical Socialism. Totalism is the only acceptable idea of the White Devil. Without the beauty and purity of Totalism, Obama would not have been able to guide the Mau-Mau with as much success as he has. Even before Totalism was formalized in that blessed Charter, Obama has been following it in his heart, as Totalism is not something that was invented. No, Totalism is inscribed on the hearts of every true African by God, and every true Mau-Mau warrior knows this. Thus it is only with Totalism, the greatest and highest of Mankind's ideals, that Africa can be freed."
KIK_only_we_can_be_the_salvation_of_kenya:0 "Only WE can be the Salvation of Kenya"
KIK_only_we_can_be_the_salvation_of_kenya_desc:0 "The time has come. What preparations could be done have been under taken, and we shall wait no longer. One more final battle, one for the Soul of Kenya, is about to take place. If we are victorious, Kenya shall be free, with Obama and Totalism at the helm. If we fail, Great Obama says we will keep fighting on, but how can we fail with Obama to lead us?"

KIK_second_uprising:0 "A Second Great Uprising"
KIK_second_uprising_desc:0 "Though Obama’s initial uprising was eventually snuffed out and driven back to the mountains and wastes of Kenya’s wilds, it was not a total failure. It planted the seed of rebellion in the hearts of the Kenyan people, and now, in the dying moments of Mittelafrika, we shall once more raise arms against the Kraut. The future is uncertain and chaos surrounds all, but the Second Mau-Mau Revolution shall not falter until all of Kenta is saved!"
KIK_gather_the_guns:0 "Gather New Guns"
KIK_gather_the_guns_desc:0 "If we are to arm the ever-growing number of revolutionaries that continue to flood into our ranks, or even supply the ones we already had, new weapons of war will be needed. However, we have no industry except for the few ‘factories’ captured from the colonizers and our local gunsmiths. We must perform raids deep into enemy territory to steal weapons, while also working to contact black market sources like the Senussi Order or the Triads to requisition more arms."
KIK_push_from_the_mountain:0 "Push From the Mountain"
KIK_push_from_the_mountain_desc:0 "Mount Kenya is both a great symbol of our revolt as well as a serious hub for our revolutionary government, with much of the mountain hiding tunnels and redoubts staffed with brave KFLA militias. Taking our knowledge of this terrain into account, we shall launch surprise attacks from the Kenyan highlands, waging a brutal guerilla war against Nairobi and other major colonialist holdouts that border the mountains. We will bleed them dry!"
KIK_end_the_colonials:0 "End the Colonials!"
KIK_end_the_colonials_desc:0 "The remaining colonists too foolish or unfortunate to be able to escape our nation have begun to group up, forming concentrated pockets of resistance. From these pockets, they still work to infest our lands and subdue our people, all in the pursuit of imperialist and capitalist gain. We shall wipe these holdouts from the map, one by one, leaving not a single Anglo, Kraut, or any other foul mzungu alive."
KIK_erase_dominionist_kenya:0 "Erase Dominionist Kenya"
KIK_erase_dominionist_kenya_desc:0 "The foul stench of the Anglos and their dead empire permeates everywhere, with even influence from the Kaiserreich forced to bask in the shade of the British dominance here in Kenya. This horrific level of infection from the perfidious Brits will not be tolerated any longer, as our administration moves to take immediate action towards limiting and eliminating any and all traces of the Dominionists and their imperialist cohorts."
KIK_demands_to_somalia:0 "Retake Our Rightful Land"
KIK_demands_to_somalia_desc:0 "To the North lies Jubbaland, a pristine valley inhabited by our people - descendants of the Bantu who speak our native tongue of Swahili and who partake in all the same customs and traditions we hold dear. We must approach the Somali overlords who now rule over the Jubba Valley, for all Kenyans belong in Kenya."
KIK_liberate_uganda:0 "Fate of Uganda?"
KIK_liberate_uganda_desc:0 "Uganda broke off from the now-dead Free State during the initial chaos of the Mittelafrikan collapse. However, despite their new Jewish suzerians, much of the population are still Africans - sons and daughters of the great Bantu civilizations that have stretched across East Africa for millenia. We must decide on what our position against this new state shall be, before another post-collapse power beats us to it."
KIK_strike_at_goering:0 "Pre-emptive Strike at Goering?"
KIK_strike_at_goering_desc:0 "Gӧring sits atop a throne of skulls in Dar-Es-Salaam, perched in his ridiculous castle playing emperor as he crushes the true sons and daughters of Africa under his boot. This must not be left to stand! The lands of the Bantu must be cleansed of all foreign taint."
KIK_congress:0 "The Future of Kenya"
KIK_congress_desc:0 "With the heartland of Kenya restored to the hands of native rule, the Kenyan Land and Freedom Army, or Mau Mau, stand triumphant over the imperialist dogs. With their enemies scattered and their former masters sent packing or sent six feet into the dirt, the future of Kenya now must be decided. The leadership of the Mau Mau is beginning to crumble as personal ambitions replace revolutionary unity. The question over who shall lead Kenya in the coming weeks is now in flux, for no one is certain now..."
KIK_obama:0 "Obama Rides On!"
KIK_obama_desc:0 "Hussein Onyango Obama has quelled the tempestuous storm that brewed amidst the inner-workings of the KFLA, arriving on the other side of this internal struggle emboldened and inspired more than ever before. Under his continued leadership, all of Africa will feel the Red Glow of Obama’s Totalist dream!"
KIK_dedan:0 "Kimathi At the Helm!"
KIK_dedan_desc:0 "Following the chaos of Obama’s untimely death, Dedan Kimathi has risen to steer the disparate and fractured Mau Mau forces back into a unified front. After dealing with the traitorous murderer Mathenge, Kimathi shall now work to bring peace, stability, and safety to the long-abused Kenyan people."
KIK_stanley:0 "Mathenge's New Order!"
KIK_stanley_desc:0 "In the wake of Obama’s constant failures and missteps, the heroic Stanley Mathenge did what no man thought possible: killing an idea. By murdering the near-prophet Obama, Mathenge snapped the brave Kikuyu people of Kenya from their trance, helping them realize their true supremacy over not only the colonizers, but to the other people of Africa. Mathenge shall now blaze a path forward to greatness, for Kinyaa!"
KIK_moving_on:0 "A New Dawn"
KIK_moving_on_desc:0 "With the dust settled and the ash clearing, one clear victor now stands above the rest in the internal struggle for power within the KFLA. Now, with the government once again coalesced around one key figure, the Mau Mau have their prophet once more. Now, together, the newly reforged and reborn KFLA shall march into a new dawn, finally free from the imperialist chains that have bound them for centuries. Harambee!"

KIK_new_kenya:0 "Kenya Reborn"
KIK_new_kenya_desc:0 "Our revolution has finally proven triumphant, and our war-torn and ragged forces now know the sweet taste of victory and freedom. Now, a free and sovereign Kenyan state stands over the ashes of the fallen colonial abomination that was the so-called ‘Free’ State. Kenya now, once again and rightfully, belongs to Kenyans, and we shall all die before we lose these lands to imperialist dogs or foreign invaders again. Harambee!"
KIK_obama_again:0 "Obama's Pan-Africa"
KIK_obama_again_desc:0 "Mzee Hussein Onyango Obama now rules solidly over the newly-freed Kenyan people, and now seeks to spread his message to all oppressed sons and daughters of this sanctified continent of Africa. Under his prophetic rule, all true Africans shall soon feel the refreshing breeze of freedom as we swoop down from these mountains, this Cradle of Humanity, and retake the Mother Continent from these imperialist hordes."
KIK_kenyan_nationalism:0 "Kenyan Nationalism"
KIK_kenyan_nationalism_desc:0 "Though many here on this Dark Continent have proven themselves worthy, steeling themselves against the unending and torturous tides of capitalist and imperialist dogs that batter this Eden so, none stand more proud and worthy than the varied peoples of Kenya. With the bravest and most righteous among us, the Kikuyu, serving as the pinnacle of our and all African peoples, Kenya shall finally prosper as these truest children of Africa guide us in the right direction as we build a modern and respected state here on the Horn. No longer shall lesser races stomp of we, the true progenitors of Humankind and Lords of the Cradle of Humanity."
KIK_honor_the_founder:0 "Honour the Founder"
KIK_honor_the_founder_desc:0 "Mzee Obama, the founder of our Kenya Land and Freedom Army and the prophetic messiah of the Mau-Mau, is the most respected and revered man in the nation, but even that is not enough! He is our muse, our protector, our shepherd; unmatched in his importance to the freedom we now enjoy and instrumental to all we now hold dear. The people of Kenya shall forever owe a debt to this hero of heroes, but all reverence must start somewhere. Obama is and forever will be the face of our people, the spirit of our nation. Every avenue will feature his face and every building will house his bust or figure in statue, for no single man is to be more respected within our borders. Obama is and forever will be the heart, the soul, the very essence of Kenya!"
KIK_militarize_kenya:0 "Kenyan Militarization"
KIK_militarize_kenya_desc:0 "The gunsmiths, factories, and assembly lines of our nation must hum alive with more energy and haste than ever before, for Kenya needs a military now more than ever. Farming tools and decades-old rifles may have been enough to earn us our independence, but we will need more than sickles and glorified muskets if we are to truly liberate all those who answer the call of our Pan-Afrikan dream. We will blacken the skies and bore deep into the earth of our Totalist Eden, sullying it if we must, for smog and debris can be cleared just as easily as the dead once our homeland is safe!"
KIK_march_on_mittelafrikas_rotting_corpse:0 "March on Mittelafrika’s Rotting Corpse!"
KIK_march_on_mittelafrikas_rotting_corpse_desc:0 "The rotted and petulant corpse that is Mittelafrika is a dead-man-walking; its days numbered as it shambles along on borrowed time, grinding all those that dare defy its unending hunger into its insatiable, greed-fueled maw. It is our duty, our destiny, to eradicate this cancerous and hedonistic hive of scum and villainy from the earth, cleansing this hallowed continent of this imperialist filth. We march for Dar-Es-Salaam, for all of Africa!"
KIK_obama_juche:0 "Kenyan Self-Sufficiency"
KIK_obama_juche_desc:0 "Kenya needs no others, for we have all we need to survive here within the Cradle of Humanity. This veritable and expansive Eden we call home shall become a beacon of self-sufficiency as we seal ourselves off from the outside world, becoming the true Red Spot of Africa. Besides, whatever we can not find within our highlands and valleys, we can find elsewhere on this expansive continent, for all of Africa is truly and rightfully ours!"
KIK_black_internationale:0 "Black Internationalism"
KIK_black_internationale_desc:0 "The African Diaspora is massive, with millions of true sons and daughters of this continent being strewn across both the Old World and the New. We must rectify this horrific situation by creating our own Internationale, an Internationale for the true and original proletariat: the Black race. Linking together elements within Europe, the Black Belt of the United States, the Carribean, across South America, and beyond, we shall reconnect with these lost siblings, forging stronger bonds as we breach the chains of our oppression, finally and together!"
KIK_divine_leader:0 "The Divine Leader"
KIK_divine_leader_desc:0 "Mzee Obama is a titanic figure, evolving well past the point of being a mere man or mortal - he has become an idea. Obama stands over the people of Kenya, and of Africa, as a demigod; a near-mythical being of untold influence and control over the souls. Obama has risen to become an avatar of anti-imperialism and Totalism itself, channeling the hate that has accumulated throughout these long centuries of oppression into a physical and effective political and cultural movement. The Grand Mzee has become the soul of Africa itself as he champions to free every last true child of this ‘Dark’ Continent."

KIK_stanley_wins:0 "Mathenge's Kinyaa"
KIK_stanley_wins_desc:0 "Stanley Mathenge has long honorably served the KLFA, but in light of the ‘prophet’ Obama’s recent traitorous acts, missteps, and failures, Mathenge has taken it into his own hands to save the Kenyan people. Slaying the false Mzee and sidestepping the heir-apparent in Kimathi, Mathenge now stands alone atop the pile of the Mau-Mau, and now only Mathenge shall decide Kenya’s destiny! For Mathenge! For Kinyaa!"
KIK_remove_anglos:0 "Remove the Anglos"
KIK_remove_anglos_desc:0 "For too long the Anglos have festered and eaten away at our homeland, from their greedy over-farming of the White Highlands to their monopolization of everything from the balance of power to our coffee industry, these imperialist dogs have barked their last cries for mercy or reproach, for under Mathenge, justice will finally be served!"
KIK_kikuyu_revival:0 "Kikuyu Revival"
KIK_kikuyu_revival_desc:0 "With the sovereignty of the varied Kenyan peoples finally secured, Mzee Mathenge has decreed that a cultural renewal of the traditional practices lost under the rule of the mzungu, with a key emphasis being placed on Kikuyu culture above the other tribal ethnicities of Kenya. Under this initiative, traditional Kenyan religions, culture, cuisine, dialects, and more shall all be revived and spread throughout the state in an attempt to stamp out colonialist influence, with no culture being more championed and publicized by the state than traditional Kikuyu practices."
KIK_kikuyu_supremacy:0 "Kikuyu Supremacy"
KIK_kikuyu_supremacy_desc:0 "As the largest of the Kenyan tribal ethnic groups, as well as being Mathenge’s own bloodline, pro-Kikyuku sentiment will be spread far and wide. Aided by the state, our regime will ensure that the clearly superior Kikuyu dialect, religion, and cultural practices all become beloved and standard across the nation; even if that means other, lesser cultures must be squashed to make room for the Kikuyu’s rightful dominance. To start, we can begin ‘ignoring’ lesser non-Bantu groups within our borders, instead showing them the light of Kikuyu culture."
KIK_rely_on_none:0 "Reliant on None"
KIK_rely_on_none_desc:0 "We have thrown off the heavy shackles of oppression, forged both by foreign invaders and by domestic ‘heroes.’ We have proven our strength and our resolve against the face of utmost destruction, and have lived to tell the tale. We Kenyans are the true sons and daughters of Africa, and we need no others to prove this. We have earned our independence alone, and we shall continue forth as such, for we need no others as we pursue our new destiny!"
KIK_help_farmers:0 "Help to the Farmers"
KIK_help_farmers_desc:0 "The Mau-Mau rebellion was birthed in the hearts of angry and oppressed farmers, angered over how the Anglo and Hunnic settlers long sullied the White Highlands: the most fertile of Kenya’s agriculturally-ready land. With their departure and our ascendance, we must undo these wrongs and finally appease the long-angered Kenyan farmer. Pastoral lands will be returned to the families they were stolen from, while new plots shall be sold and distributed to those who have proven their loyalty to Mathenge and the new Kinyaan state, for we shall not make the same mistake and let unworthy hands work our precious soils."
KIK_heirs_to_bantu:0 "Heirs to Bantu"
KIK_heirs_to_bantu_desc:0 "The Bantu were some of the first Children of Africa; their triumphs and civilization-building legacy now lie within the blood and hearts of all true Kinyaans. We stand here at the Northern edge of their historic extent, atop these peaks staring down at the rest of our kin and siblings on this Dark Continent. We are the heirs to these kings, these progenitors and civilizers. We carry their legacy to the modern day, and shall ride down from our bastion in Mount Kenya to liberate their right heartlands from the vile clutches of imperialists and false prophets, for it is our birthright!"

KIK_dedan_wins:0 "Kimathi’s Kenya"
KIK_dedan_wins_desc:0 "Dedan Kimathi has long served under the prophet Mzee Obama, serving as his protege and adoptive son as the two grow together as both colleagues and friends. With the tragic passing of the Founder, Kimathi stands alone as the last hope of a Kenya molder in Obama’s image. Now serving as father to not only the orphaned son of the late Mzee but to the entire Kenyan nation as well, it is up to Kimathi to take up the reigns of a fallen god in order to save his people and the ideals of his mentor."
KIK_international_collaboration:0 "Internationale Collaboration"
KIK_international_collaboration_desc:0 "Unlike Mathenge or Obama. Kimathi has bregurdingly accepted the fact that without outside recognition and support, even in our current victory the Mau-Mau would still likely know defeat in the end. To avoid this, Kimathi has reached out to the varied Socialist parties of the Third Internationale and its affiliated organizations in hopes to find foreign support for the KLFA’s righteous cause."
KIK_destroy_plantation_system:0 "Destroy the Plantation System"
KIK_destroy_plantation_system_desc:0 "The plantation system established by the British and inherited by the Krauts has long stagnated the economy of Kenya for the natives while only filling the pockets of the foregin settlers. Seeking to finally end this corrupt system for all, Kimathi has called for a slew of collectivization policies to be enacted, tearing down the old capitalist order while ushering in a new age of egalitarian economics for Kenya farmers. No longer shall these foreigners plague our lands and sully our fertile soil!"
KIK_nativize_angloism:0 "Nativize Angloism"
KIK_nativize_angloism_desc:0 "The Anglos have left behind a decent amount of infrastructure, both political, industrial, and socioeconomic, that could easily be refitted for use by our new state, reducing the need to radically rebuild much of the Kenyan administrative apparatus. We shall work tirelessly to remove all foreign taint from these institutions and systems, cleansing them in the Red Light of Socialism as we build a modern Kenyan state."

KIK_de_angloize_the_church_desc:0 "The Anglican Church of Kenya stands as the largest organized religious institution in the nation, holding considerable influence over our massive Christian population. We must work to strip away any and all lingering European influences within these churches to limit the colonizer’s influence over the minds and souls of our faithful. By implementing new policies such as holding more masses in Swahili, integrating more traditional native beliefs, and through eliminating all White clergymen from positions of influence, we shall cleanse these houses of God from the taint of these blasphemers."
KIK_unify_kenya:0 "Kenya United!"
KIK_unify_kenya_desc:0 "Kenya has long been an internally divided and fractorious place. We must first focus on repairing the wounds and divisions that still exist between our people before we can ever attempt any wider goals or Pan-Afrikan dream like the late Founder desperately dreamed of. By combating dangerous ideas such as radical nationalism and Kikuyu supremacism, we shall bridge the schisms that divide our peoples, for we must become Kenyans, one and all, before we can become anything else."
KIK_local_level_democracy:0 "Local Level Democracy"
KIK_local_level_democracy_desc:0 "With our old divisions beginning to heal and our political in-fighting seemingly behind us for now, Kimathi has pushed forward with his plan to bring about true local democracy to all Kenyans. Though Kimathi shall still lead as total and supreme Mzee, local governments from the town and tribal councils to city and provincial parliaments, true Socialist democracy shall be brought to all Kenyans, finally giving these long silenced people a voice."

KIK_new_kenyan_army:0 "Rebuild The KLFA"
KIK_new_kenyan_army_desc:0 "The Kenyan Land and Freedom Army, or as they are more widely known as the Mau-Mau, served valiantly in both Great Uprisings, somehow defeating an industrialized superpower with decades-old rifles, rusty knives, and farming tools. However, these archaic weapons will not serve us so well in the coming wars of tomorrow, and so, the KLFA must adapt and evolve, lest all of Kenya become as outdated as they are."
KIK_army_of_militas:0 "Reform The Militias"
KIK_army_of_militas_desc:0 "The farmer militias that comprised the KLFA during the Great Uprisings served our people well in the fires of war that earned us our freedom - we should not forget this legacy. We shall double down on our use of militias as the basic structure of the new KLFA, while also modernizing the tactics and equipment at their disposal, in order to create a truly egalitarian and effective fighting force to defend our newly--sovereign home."
KIK_organized_army:0 "Reforge The Militias"
KIK_organized_army_desc:0 "Though the ragtag groups of farmers and labourers that won us our independence were surely the bravest generation our people have ever known, their victory over the imperialist dogs was purely luck. Kenya’s future can not be gambled away on the backs of aging farmers again, and so Kenya requires a modern, organized, and professional army. The militias will be disbanded with a professional army raised in its place, for numbers and zeal may have won us our first fight, but the next fight will be won with careful planning and overwhelming firepower."
KIK_buy_planes:0 "Swarm The Skies"
KIK_buy_planes_desc:0 "Our armed forces must take to the skies if we are to fully and effectively combat the imperialist forces that plague our continent. New air bases will need to be constructed, for we sorely lack available airstrips within our borders. More importantly, we reach out to ‘friendly’ regimes and black market contacts in order to requisition enough planes to start the Kenyan Air Force, as well as the plans needed to manufacture our own flying beasts as well once our industrial centers are up and running."

These tactics shall be adapted and emulated by a new generation of Liberian soldiers, all trained in the use of modern motorized vehicles and other forms of fast locomotion and relocation, in order to create a new breed of lightning-fast war here in Africa - one to outpace the slow machinations and movements of the remaining imperialist powers."

The white man covered in a shemagh simply and calmly replied back, “Do you know where your boss is?” Before long the platoon commander of Ngure unit came up, “So do you have it?” “Right I do, the convoy is coming up soon, here’s your next target.” He said, throwing a packet to the platoon leader. After the horsemen rode off the platoon followed down the trail to where a stopped convoy was. Soon white men came out and began loading into the last truck. “Good luck with your little rebellion, Mate! You’ll need it!” The man said waving his hand as they drove away. At this moment Ngure questioned his Platoon leader, “Why are taking arms from the white devils?” and then the leader replied back with venom, “Who are you to question what our leader Obama mandated!

Staring out at the horizon, he beholds the vast expanse of the land around him, this cradle of humankind and birthplace of our species. A land so pure and diverse in its life, with jungles deep and mystifying and mountaintops that stab into the sky, desperate to touch the gods above. This wondrous land is the birthright of all men and women on this green Earth, and yet this very moment a perverse and twisted force rapes and pillages these lands for profit, greed, and selfish personal gain: the Europeans. These pasty-faced demons lie and deceive with their promises of civilization and progress and yet the land weeps under their every move and the people of Kenya suffer for it. They are downtrodden and abused, oppressed under harsh conditions, forced to toil and slave away just to have it be stolen away in the markets of the White Man. No. No longer, Obama thought to himself as he broke from his trance, staring at the blood-red sunrise as his thoughts took flight. He knew what he had to do. He and his Mau-Mau guerillas would free Kenya and cleanse this filth from these primordial lands. With the light of Totalism guiding them as the light of the dawn had guided his journey up the mountain, Obama knew he would not falter in this fight. The Mountain’s final test was upon him, and he knew he would succeed, for Kenya, for Totalism!"

Obama quickly got off the horse and onto his own and rode in front of his men. “Comrades! These seem to be our final days!” The men chant ‘The Mau-Maus will never end!’ for several times before Obama got them to quit it, “Over these past years I have learned that change can only come from the bottom-up for the oppressed peoples of Africa! We Mau-Maus have built a model community that served to make the people’s lives better!” The men were ecstatic, readied, and willing to die for Obama. Obama quietly orders them into the formation Fitzgerald had taught them in the days before this battle. With a single word- interrupted by the only White Man trusted by Obama and Kimathi,F Scott Fitzgerald. “So you’ve decided to stick with us! The Germans will have you hanged and quartered like the rest of us!” Shouted Obama to the journalist that had once been their prisoner. “These past few months I have been your brother! Let me ride with my brothers one more time!” Fitzgerald said to Obama and his men. “Then ride with us! Join us in battle...one more time.” Obama smiled now with Fitzgerald at their side they could probably keep the formation together before contact with the Germans.

The fighting was some of the bloodiest Africa had seen breaking the Mau-Maus back sending them fleeing to Mau Forest and the Mountains of Kenya. This wouldn’t be the end for them, too many have escaped to fight the Germans another day.\nObama badly wounded from the charge managed to find himself at the horse ranch where they had prepared that attack. He hid inside it’s barn trying to lay low until he could escape back to men. Sadly enough the Germans weren’t as stupid as he thought. Soon a whole platoon had gathered, he knew this was going to happen. He didn’t want to believe it. Shame he had to disappoint Dedan, his most loyal follower, but hopefully he’ll take charge of the moment as he made him promise to do. It was time Obama was ready to meet his final doom. Before he would meet his end he was determined to bring down as many as he could drawing his C-96 he fired off multiple shots he knew he hit, but he didn’t know how many had died. A SMLE took him into his next life martyred by the oppressors of Africa for freedom for all of Africa.\nThe two ran somehow managing to escape that massacre. Before long Obama had to stop running to catch his breath that took some cover before long Dedan spoke to him, “So is this how we plan to end? Dying in some forgotten town.” Dedan angrily said at him Obama quickly replied back. “Everything's coming together...exactly as I’ve planned.” Dedan merely was confused, “How the hell is coming together!

At 14:00 yesterday (at the time of this report) the Mau-Maus used horses taken from an English Settler Ranch, (said Settler had been dead since the start of the uprising), and conducted a final charge upon us. Despite surprisingly overwhelming our lines when they’ve gotten to our back line we’d set up several maxims and had them mowed down. There were also reports of a white man among them, but no one among the defense forces was able to confirm this. It was possible he was able to escape after the carnage that was the cavalry charge. Obama was confirmed to have escaped his failed attempt at victory. Found in a barn he attempted to shoot his way out is belived to have been shot dead, not before killing 5 and wounding 2. We have so-far been unable to find Obama's body, despite the men who went to after him confiriming his death. Hopefully with his death we’ll be able to deal with the remains of what's left of this annoying rebellion.

It goes on about Mau-Mau’s tactics and ideals, their leader Hussein Obama, and Obama’s personal involvement in the rebellion, which critics state are quite dubious.

I’m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something — there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there.\n\n If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable Kenyan system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business — you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The telegraph didn’t get invented on its own. Government research created the telegraph so that all the companies could make money off the telegraph.\n\n The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together. There are some things, just like fighting fires, we don’t do on our own. I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service. That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires. \n\n So we say to ourselves, ever since the founding of this country, you know what, there are some things we do better together. That’s how we'll free Kenya. That’s how we'll defeat the Hun! That’s how we'll a build a Totalist Nation! That’s how we'll free all of Africa!

obama.14.d:0 "“We meet at a moment of great uncertainty for Kenya. The economic crisis we face is the worst in our modern history. Markets across the globe have become increasingly unstable, and millions of Kenyans will open up their wallets this week and see that so much of their hard-earned cash has disappeared.	760,000 workers have lost their jobs this week alone. Unemployment here in Kenya 85% over the last eight years, which is the highest it's been in sixteen years. You've lost one of every four manufacturing jobs, the typical Kenyan family has seen their income fall $25, and it's getting harder and harder to make the rent, or fill up your stomach, or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month. At this rate, the question isn't just are you better off than you were four years ago?, it's are you better off than you were four weeks ago? \n\n We still have the most talented, most productive workers of any country on Earth. We're still home to innovation and technology, colleges and universities that are the envy of the world. Some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and our research facilities. It won't be easy, but there's no reason we can't make this century the Kenyan century. \n\n But it will take a new direction. It will take new leadership in Nairobi. It will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last years.  \n\n Over the course of the Bush War, I've laid out a set of policies that will grow our middle-class and strengthen our economy in the long-term. I'll reform our tax code so that 95% of workers and their families get a tax cut, and eliminate income taxes for seniors making under $50,000. I'll bring down the cost of healthcare for families and businesses by investing in preventative care, new technology, and giving every Kenyan the chance to get the same kind of health insurance that members of the Colonial Authority  give themselves. We'll ensure every child can compete in the global economy by recruiting an army of new teachers and making college affordable for anyone who wants to go. We'll create five million new, high-wage jobs by investing in the renewable sources of energy that will eliminate the oil we currently import from the Middle East in ten years, and we'll create two million jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads, schools and bridges. It's a serious challenge. But we can do it if we act now, and if we act as one nation. We can bring a new era of responsibility and accountability to Kenya and to Nairobi.  \n\n Together, we cannot fail. Not now. Not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save. Not when there are so many Kenyans without jobs and without homes. Not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor, or send their child to college, or pay their bills at the end of the month. Not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves. \n\n Now it falls to us. Together, we cannot fail! Together, we can overcome the broken policies and divided politics of the last eighty years! Together, we can renew an economy that rewards work and rebuilds the middle class! Together, we can create millions of new jobs,  and deliver on the promise of healthcare you can afford and education that helps your kids compete! We can do this if we come together, if we have confidence in ourselves and each other, if we look beyond the darkness of the day to the bright light of hope that lies ahead. Together, we can change this country and change this world. Thank you, and remember, Only Totalism and Only I can lead Kenya to freedom!”"

But there should be no disagreement on what the men and women of our military have achieved.\n\n And so I want to be very clear: We are fighting to do away with the Hun – and we will do that. We will leave the Kenyan people with a hard-earned opportunity to live a better life – that is your achievement; that is the prospect that you have made possible. \n\n There are many lessons to be learned from what we’ve experienced. We have learned that the Mau-Mau must go to war with clearly defined goals.. We have learned that we must always weigh the costs of action, and communicate those costs candidly to the Kenyan people. We have learned that in the 20th century, we must use all elements of Kenyan power to achieve our objectives, which is why I am committed to building our civilian national security capacity so that the burden is not continually pushed on to our military. We have learned that our political leaders must pursue the broad and bipartisan support that our national security policies depend upon, which is why I will consult with no other man when carrying out my plans. And we have learned the importance of working closely with friends and allies, which is why we are launching a new era of engagement in the Bush War. \n\n The starting point for our policies must alway the freedom of the Kenyan people. I know that you – the men and women of the finest fighting force in the history of the world – can meet any challenge, and defeat any foe. And as your Commander-in-Chief, I promise you that I will only send you into harm’s way when it is absolutely necessary, and provide you with the equipment and support you need to get the job done. That is the most important lesson of all – for the consequences of war are dire, the sacrifices immeasurable. \n\n You know because you have seen those sacrifices. You have lived them. And we all honor them. \n\n Each Kenyan who has served with the Mau-Mau has their own story. Each of you has your own story. And that story is now a part of the history of the Kenyan people– a people that exists only because free men and women have bled for it from the beaches to the deserts. From the mountains to the street. You teach us that the price of freedom is great. Your sacrifice should challenge all of us – every single Kenyan – to ask what we can do to be better citizens. \n\n There will be more danger in the months ahead. We will face new tests and unforeseen trials. But thanks to the sacrifices of those who have served, we have forged hard-earned progress, we WILL drive the Hun from this land and we shall have peace! \n\n Thank you, and may the Light of Totalism lead us to victory!”"

We know the nooks and crannies of this earth better than all and have used this knowledge to help keep our popular movement alive, waging a brutal guerilla war against these perfidious Europeans and their unending greed. We lie in our rocky fortresses and desert dens trapped like a cornered fox in its lair, ready to lash out and strike at any who would dare try to divorce us from our lands. \nOur brave leader, the grand Mzee Hussein Onyango Obama, guides our infantile insurrection the best he can, shepherding our flock as we constantly take flight from the ever pursuing Kenyan Frontier Forces. His near-divine leadership has even inspired many to take worship of this messiah to the Kenya worker, and saviour to the people of Africa as a whole.

We could simply ignore his petulant rampage, hiding away in the mountain fortresses and redoubts that dot the Kenyan highlands, but that is no legacy for the KFLA to bear. Instead, we could ride into Dar-Es-Salaam and topple Gӧring’s vile regime once and for all, slaying the largest beast of German Imperialism with one swift blow."

redkenya.6.d:0 "After decades of struggle against rival powers and European imperialism, Kenya now stands, proud and free, as a whole and sovereign nation. The Bantu people of our kin and the land of our ancestors have been unified under one flag, one man, one idea. Our shepherd in these dark times, [tag.getleader], has been the beacon to which all within Kenya have turned to, and under his guidance, our people and our history have been saved. Under [KIK.getleader], our once fractured national identity has been reforged and strengthened beyond compare, and these new bonds shall become the foundations of our new future, so let us all pull together as we face our destiny!"

redkenya.7.d:0 "Over the past few months, the former lands of Kenya-Uganda have been embroiled in a status of constant chaos. With Mittelafrika's inevitable collapse and the rising of Obama from the dead, the people of Kenya can finally breath free, knowing that the forces of the Mau-Mau have finally emerged victories after nearly two decades of war, and saved them from the imperialist dogs of the Anglo and Hunnic empires. However, with that victory comes the beginnings of division among the ranks of the Mau-Mau.\n\nDuring the neigh three year period of Obama's absence, Dedan Kimathi did his best to keep the Mau-Mau united, until such time has Barrack come of age, when he could follow in his father's footsteps to become the salvation of Kenya. However Kimathi was no Obama, lacking his former mentor's charisma and natural leadership. While a good leader in his own right, Kimathi was never able to fit into the enormous shoes of Obama. This lack of strong leadership inevitably lead to the rise of divisions within the Mau-Mau's ranks, mostly centered around the highly nationalistic and Bantu revivalist Stanley Mathenge. While never outright challenging Dedan's leadership, it was clear that he would be idle once victory was finally won. When Obama suddenly reappeared, once more claiming leadership over the Mau-Mau, Mathenge quickly fell in line, although still clearly harboring his own ideas for the future of Kenya. With victory over Imperialist forces finally won and the Mau-Mau at peace for the first time since it's creation, Mathenge has made his move, using several loyalist units to try and capture the capital and with it, Obama, the man in his way too power.\n\n As fighting around [tag.getcapital] heats up, Mathenge has been able to breach Obama's compouned. Just as Mathenge is able to breach Obama's office, a flash of gunfire hails into and out from the room. After a two minute exchange of gunfire, the bullets finally stop flying, and as Mathenge's entoruge looks into around they see..."                   "

redkenya.8.d:0 "It was a cool night; the clear, star-filled sky showed the expanding cosmos as the light of the full moon illuminated the highlands of Kenya’s heartland. Rising above it all, threatening to pierce the sky itself, stood Mount Kenya. On this mountain, years ago, Obama, Kimathi, Mathenge, and many others first congregated, swearing loyalty to one another as they both birthed the KLFA and sparked the fire of the Mau-Mau Revolution to life. \n\nNow, Mzee Obama sat alone at its peak, meditating on his people’s victory and the coming trials ahead, or so he thought… \n\nFor all his victories and triumphs, Obama still held one great failure in his heart: the loss of his student’s respect, for of his two proteges, one had grown long tired of Obama’s empty platitudes and haughty proselytizing. Stanley Mathenge, once heir apparent to the Mau-Mau in Obama’s absence, had long fallen second to Dedan Kimathi, current second-in-command and near-son of the Grand Mzee, over Mathenge’s own prediction for more traditionalist and nationalist views on most of the issues the KLFA has faced. With these disagreements having formed a schism between these titans of Kenyan political affairs, Mathenge’s bitterness and resentment over his former master has long festerd and grown, and now he stalks his aging mentor like a jaguar hunting its prey. \n\nAs Obama sits in meditation, listening to his inner thoughts as the howling winds of this stormy peak clear his mind, and conceal his would-be assassin’s tracks, Mathenge has slowly crept up the mountaintop and now stands just meters from the Grand Mzee’s tranquil form. As the young firebrand began to step forward, however, a twig snapped under his footfall, a blunder forced on by his over-eager readiness to strike, alerted the prophet, who immediately leaped to his feet, drawing his knife and readying his counter to Mathenge’s rush. Within moments, the two titans were at each other's throats, exchanging slashes and jabs in a fierce display of force as they battled for the spirit and future of Kenya itself. \n\nAs the the fight dragged on and the howling winds turned into a torrential storm, these two demigods of Kenyan idealism were close to exhaustion as their battle drew nearer to its end. In one final effort, both warriors charge each other, with the winner proving to be whomever could draw their blade the quickest. \n\nIn a flash that struck with the rolling thunder and lighting of this alpine storm, blood was drawn and a body fell. Kenya can only have one Mzee, one prophet, and that man has proven to be..."

redkenya.9.t:0 "Death Pangs of the Old Order"
redkenya.9.d:0 "With Obama finally well and truly dead by Mathenge's own hand, the new self-proclaimed leader of Mau-Mau has moved to secure his hold on Kenya. While the capital may be secured, Mathenge's hold on power is far from stable. Resistance to his rule is already being reported, most notably in the figure of Dedan Kimathi, his old rival. Kimathi had been on assignment at the Ethiopian border, as the Imperial Army was allegedly mobilizing in reaction to the Mau-Mau's victory. With word of Obama's second and true death spreading like wildfire, Kimathi has resolved to avenge Obama, and if possible rescue his son who was reportedly captured by Mathenge. As Kimathi rides on towards [tag.getcapital] he is reminded of the last time he saw Obama, before his first death, making his resolve all the stronger. Approaching the capital, the fighting is intense and blood hangs over the air like an ungodly fog. As the day comes to end and the fighting stops, it is clear that..."

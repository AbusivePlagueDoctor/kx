### Events ###
kub.1.t:0 "History of the Kuban's People Republic"
kub.1.d:0 "Proclaimed in 1918, Kuban People's Republic was on the right side of the hedge in the chaos of the Russian Civil War. A stable economic growth, democracy and cooperation made it possible for Kuban to become one of the most successful splinter states of the Russian Empire. Unceasing conflicts between two parliamentary groups, pro-Ukranian and pro-Russian ensured good relations both with Russia and Reichspact. However, who knows if it is not just a calm before the storm."
kub.1.a:0 "You, Kuban, you're our Motherland!"

kub.2.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Kuban"

kub.3.a:0 "Glory to Ataman!"

kub.4.t:0 "Elections of the New Ataman"
kub.4.d:0 "After the death of Ataman Bukretov, the Regional Rada should vote for a new ataman and the Cossack Circle, consisting of the supreme Cossack leaders should appoint the new Ataman. There are two candidates, from each faction: Vasiliy Ivanis, supported by Chernomortsy, and Aleksandr Filimonov, supported by Lineitsy." 
kub.4.a:0 "Let us wait for the result."

kub.5.t:0 "New Ataman Elected"
kub.5.d:0 "The campaign is over and the Cossack Circle is ready to appoint the new Ataman, elected by the Regional Rada."
kub.5.a:0 "Ivanis is the new Ataman."
kub.5.b:0 "Filimonov is the new Ataman."

kub.6.t:0 "1936 Kuban Elections"
kub.6.d:0 "This year in the elections there are two political forces participating: Chernomortsy, who are allied with Ukraine and Lineitsy, who are allied with Russia. The result will depend on the popularity of the parties amongst the citizens."
kub.6.a:0 "Let us wait for the result."

kub.60.t:0 "Chernomortsy Victorous!"
kub.60.d:0 "Due to the popular campaigns and propaganda of the Chernomortsy faction, it gained the majority of votes."
kub.60.a:0 "Congratulations."

kub.61.t:0 "Lineitsy Victorous!"
kub.61.d:0 "Due to the popular campaigns and propaganda of the Lineitsy faction, it gained the majority of votes."


kub.7.t:0 "Start the Spring Session"
kub.7.d:0 "The New Year Holidays are over and it is time to start the annual Kuban Regional Rada session.\nAs usual, the main debates are between the plans of Lineitsy and Chernomortsy factions. This time we shall discuss the direction of the economy, a new Army Reform, and several internal issues we are currently dealing with."
kub.7.a:0 "Exciting!"

kub.8.t:0 "Nikolay Ryabovol Opening Speech"
kub.8.d:0 "Nikolay Ryabovol, one of the leaders of the Chernomortsy faction, has spoken today in the Regional Rada, demanding further cooperation with Mitteleuropa, firstly, with Ukraine and with Germany, in particular.\nAs the question of Kuban's foreign policy still stays unsolved, the topic of becoming a member of the German sphere of influence is a hot debate between the deputies."
kub.8.a:0 "Chernomortsy trying to draw us away from Russia."

kub.9.t:0 "Filimonov's Address to the Nation"
kub.9.d:0 "Aleksandr Filimonov has presented the Lineitsy's 1936 National Budget, which includes cooperation with Russian government. While many claim that Filimonov's speech is a criticizing response to Ryabovol's Ukrainophile plan, the idea of returning back to Russia is a popular idea amongst Kuban citizens."

kub.10.t:0 "The Upcoming Elections"
kub.10.d:0 "This year is also coming with the new legislative regional elections, with an active political campaign of both Chernomortsy and Lineitsy. Currently, Chernomortsy hold the majority in the parliament, having 32 seats out of 60 in the Regional Rada and Luka Bych being the current prime minister and chairman of Rada.\nThis will be a challenge for Lineitsy to get the majority, however, they also have plenty of supporters in Kuban."
kub.10.a:0 "Who will win?"

kub.11.t:0 "Direction of the Economy"
kub.11.d:0 "With Ataman Bukretov trying to keep Kuban's neutrality, both factions in the Rada have their own economic plans for Kuban. While Chernomortsy look forward to cooperating with prosperous economies of Germany and Ukraine, Lineitsy see our future with Russia and its developing economy. While some predict the very end of the German economy, some hope that the new Russian government will become a vital world economy in the next few years."
kub.11.a:0 "Chernomortsy are right - we must cooperate with Germany."
kub.11.b:0 "Lineitsy are right - Russia has potential."

kub.12.t:0 "Cossack Army"
kub.12.d:0 "The Kuban Cossack Host, consisting of Black Sea and Caucasus Line cossacks hosts needs to be reformed as soon as possible. In the new century the cavalry cannot protect our nation from tanks and mechanized forces of foreign powers.\nTwo plans that are available for us are proposed: turning our forces into motorized ones or improving the artillery and equipment."
kub.12.a:0 "Motorized Cossack Force!"
kub.12.b:0 "Improve the Artillery."

kub.13.t:0 "Kuban Asks for a Bailout"
kub.13.d:0 "The governemnt of the Kuban People's Republic has asked us for a bailout. While we are currently trying to deal with our problems first, Kuban can be a vital ally in our confrontation with Russia and open Caucasus for us - and its black gold."
kub.13.a:0 "Help them a bit."
kub.13.b:0 "Promise something, do nothing."
kub.13.c:0 "Who is Kuban?"

kub.14.t:0 "Germany Agreed to Help"
kub.14.d:0 "German Empire agreed to help us, despite all the instability. This is a great victory for Chernomortsy, indeed, as it opens ways for further cooperation with Mitteleuropa."
kub.14.a:0 "Splendid!"

kub.15.t:0 "Germany Promise to Help"
kub.15.d:0 "Germany promised to help our economy to recover. However, their help is not totally guaranteed. But we can rely on this information and try to get closer to Germany in the future."
kub.15.a:0 "Something, at least."

kub.16.t:0 "Germany Refused to Help"
kub.16.d:0 "German government refused to help us! This is a great dissapointment for Chernomortsy and their voters."
kub.16.a:0 "Perhaps we shall work with Russia then?"

kub.17.d:0 "The government of the Kuban People's Republic has asked us for a bailout. While we are currently trying to deal with our own problems firsy, it can be a first step to peacefully return Kuban into the Motherland."
kub.17.c:0 "We don't negotiate with traitors."

kub.18.t:0 "Russia Agreed to Help"
kub.18.d:0 "Russia agreed to help us, despite all the instability. This is a great victory for Lineitsy, indeed, as it opens ways for further cooperation with Russia."

kub.20.t:0 "Russia Refused to Help"
kub.20.d:0 "Russian government refused to help us! This is a great dissapointment for Lineitsy and their voters."
kub.20.a:0 "Perhaps we shall work with Germany then?"

kub.21.t:0 "Economy Recovers"
kub.21.d:0 "Thanks to all the measures, our economy starts to slowly recover from the Berlin Stock Crisis."
kub.21.a:0 "Amazing!"

kub.22.t:0 "Language Issue"
kub.22.d:0 "Same as parliamentary factions, our nation is split between Ukrainian-speaking and Russian-speaking regions. However, Ukrainian is still not an official language in our country, despite all the efforts, made by Chernomortsy. This issue shall be solved this year, and Chernomortsy are already promising to finally solve it."
kub.22.a:0 "A great pre-election promise."

kub.23.t:0 "Circassian Minority"
kub.23.d:0 "The nation, known as Circassians or Adyghe is a muslim minority, that lives in the Adygea and North Caucasus districts in Kuban. While their district have representation in the Regional Rada with North Caucasus having 4 seats and Adygea only 1 seat, they are held by Chernomortsy or Lineitsy deputies. The Circassians de-facto have no representation in the parliament and currently they don't have equal rights with other Kuban citizens. This issue has been a headache since the foundation of the Kuban People's Republic, leading to strained relations with the Mountain Republic who recognize Circassia as a part of their state. We shall guarantee equal rights for Circassians in the following convocation of Regional Rada."
kub.23.a:0 "Another issue to deal with."  

kub.24.t:0 "Ukrainian As a Second Language?"
kub.24.d:0 "The issue of the Ukrainian language should be finally solved. Now there are three options for us: recognize Ukrainian language as a second official language in the Kuban, forbid Ukrainian language or keep the status quo. The choice depends on our government, however."
kub.24.a:0 "Make Ukrainian the official language."
kub.24.b:0 "Keep the status quo."
kub.24.c:0 "Forbid to speak Ukrainian."

kub.25.t:0 "The Peasantry-Cossack Conflict"
kub.25.d:0 "Since the foundation of the Kuban People's Republic the conflict between cossacks and peasantry has been a major problem. The cossacks, which make up less than 50% of Kuban's population own 80% of land and production, while local peasantry lives in poverty and vain. When Kuban once again declared its independnce in 1925, the situation became much better, with peasants having voting rights and land being nationalized. However, the policy of ataman Bukretov led to oppression of peasants. The Regional Rada should do something about this, either helping peasants and farmers or finally centralising our state under Cossack rule."
kub.25.a:0 "Favour the peasants."
kub.25.b:0 "Favour the cossacks."

kub.26.t:0 "The Circassian Minority"
kub.26.d:0 "Something should be done with the Circassian issue. We can either grant them autonomy and receive popularity and stability in the region, or let them leave for the Mountain Republic and make Circassia a true cossack land."
kub.26.a:0 "An autonomy for Circassians."
kub.26.b:0 "Send the to Mountaineers."

kub.27.t:0 "Abkhazia"
kub.27.d:0 "The region of Abkhazia, especially the city of Sochi is populated by Russians and Ukrainians in majority. However, Georgia has seized these lands from us when Kuban was already annexed by Russia. We can either demand the return of this land, demand an autonomy for Kubans or keep the status-quo."
kub.27.a:0 "Demand Sochi back."
kub.27.b:0 "Demand autonomy for Kubans in Abkhazia."
kub.27.c:0 "Save the status-quo."

kub.28.t:0 "Georgia Accepts."
kub.28.d:0 "Georgia agreed to return Abkhazia. This is a great victory for our foreign ministry."
kub.28.a:0 "Splendid."

kub.29.t:0 "Georgia Refused."
kub.29.d:0 "Georgia refused to return Abkhazia. This is a great disaster."
kub.29.a:0 "Fight for our lands."
kub.29.b:0 "We are too weak to fight." 

kub.290.t:0 "Peace with Kuban?"
kub.290.d:0 "The Kuban forces have occupied Abkhazia. We can sign a peace treaty and end the war, until it is too late."
kub.290.a:0 "Offer them peace."
kub.290.b:0 "We will never surrender."

kub.291.t:0 "Georgia Offers Peace"
kub.291.d:0 "The government of Georgia offered us peace and Abkhazia."
kub.291.a:0 "Accept the treaty."
kub.291.b:0 "We shall destroy Georgia."

kub.292.t:0 "Peace with Georgia?"
kub.292.d:0 "We were unable to occupy Abkhazia. We must send peace to Georgia to stop this aimless war."
kub.293.t:0 "Kuban Offers Peace"
kub.293.d:0 "The government of Kuban offered us peace."
kub.293.b:0 "We shall destroy these cossacks."

kub.30.t:0 "Reforming the Regional Rada"
kub.30.d:0 "While the traditional system of Kuban Regional Rada has been keeping our nation together with Chernomortsy and Lineitsy counterbalancing each other, we should adapt a more democratic and more pro-Russian system of State Duma: a regular parliament with open elections. The Regional Rada will be disbanned and the State Duma should appear instead."
kub.30.a:0 "Let's do this."


kub.100.t:0 "The Savior Is Here"
kub.100.d:0 "Today, the armed cossack forces of general Viktor Pokrovskiy have rushed into the Ataman's residence in Yekaterinodar and arrested Bukretov. Soon after Pokrovskiy proclaimed himself the new Ataman of the Republic and dissolved the Rada. Due to the incompetence of the former government to protect people, as Pokrovskiy argued, his duty is to save his Motherland from chaos and anarchy."
kub.100.a:0 "The Savior will protect us."

kub.101.t:0 "Dissolve the Kuban Regional Rada"
kub.101.d:0 "The Rada has for long been a hurdle on our way with its deputies sitting there for 10 years, arguing and doing nothing. The Rada should be immediately dissolved. Those who are not with us are against us. Only the firm hand of our new Ataman will help us to overcome the crisis."
kub.101.a:0 "Close this talking shop."

kub.102.t:0 "Ban Ukrainian Parties"
kub.102.d:0 "Several Ukrainian parties, including USDRP and UPSF, which closely cooperated with Chernomortsy faction, have nothing to do in our country. They had no chance to sustain their democracy in Ukraine and it is stupid to think they can succeed in a foreign country."
kub.102.a:0 "Kuban for Kubans"

kub.103.t:0 "Ban Ukrainian Language"
kub.103.d:0 "For too long the Ukrainian influence has been spreading into the Kuban. Since the first Chernomortsy party programme where they stated that the Kuban should be a part of Ukraine, this plague has taken its tithe of our people. We should ban to speak Ukrainian in public places, in official meetings, ban teaching Ukrainian at schools and universities."
kub.103.a:0 "Worth enough to save the nation."

kub.104.t:0 "Traitors Everywhere!"
kub.104.d:0 "Kuban is being dissolving into parts. Whoever they are - Ukrainians, Circassians, Chechens, Kalmyks - they all want their piece of a pie. Since now, as the Savior has told, we will consolidate our grip over Kuban and destroy all the enemies of the state."
kub.104.a:0 "Everything for the state!"



kub.200.t:0 "The Don-Kuban Union?"
kub.200.d:0 "The peoples of Don and Kuban are ethnically, culturally and politically the one nation. We should end the era of separation and finally proclaim the United Don-Kuban republic, a republic for cossacks!"
kub.200.a:0 "Send the offer to the Don Republic"

kub.201.d:0 "The government of the Don-Kuban Union has offered to join them in an union. While our nations can be similar in a variety of facts, our political interests can differ greately."
kub.201.a:0 "Accept their offer - the Cossacks should be united."
kub.201.b:0 "Nonsence! We will never agree."

kub.202.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Agreed!"
kub.202.d:0 "The Don government agreed to sign the Union treaty."
kub.202.a:0 "Lyubo, bratsy, lyubo!"

kub.203.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refused!"
kub.203.d:0 "The Don government refused to sign the Union treaty."
kub.203.a:0 "We shall crush these traitors!"
kub.203.b:0 "War will only tear us apart, not unite."

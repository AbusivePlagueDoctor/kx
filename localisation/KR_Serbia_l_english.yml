serbia.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Serbia"
serbia.1.d:0 "The assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand by a Serb nationalist in 1914 proved to be the catalyst that began the Weltkrieg. Despite expecting an easy campaign, Austrian forces only managed to occupy Serbia itself in late 1915, and because of the entrance of Bulgaria in the war. After the war Serbia's southern territories were handed over to Bulgaria, whilst the remainder was kept under Austrian occupation until 1926, when the Austrians were forced to withdraw their troops due to ethnic tensions elsewhere in the Empire.\n\nSince then Serbia has struggled to survive, keeping a low profile in light of the knowledge that she could not stand up to any sort of military attack. Over time however the government has become increasingly anti-Austrian and jingoistic, and knowing that they could not hope to defeat Austria they have instead turned their attentions southwards, towards the lands occupied by Bulgaria. Several diplomatic talks have already been conducted with the Romanian and Greek governments with a view to undermining Bulgarian hegemony in the region, and some say talk of a formal alliance is not far off.\n\nCan Serbia successfully steer a course to triumph in the 'Bulgarian Matter'? And if so, can she finally defeat the old enemy Austria, and realise her dream of a pan-Slavic Union?"

serbia.28.a:0 "Albania is a part of the Serbian state!"
serbia.28.b:0 "Abandon our attempts."

serbia.29.t:0 "Call for Revolution in Albania"
serbia.29.d:0 "Our integration process of Albania has not been successful. The local population continues to resist our occupation in great numbers, making life very hard for Serbians.

Through the sea of people gathering in front of the old royal palace, Black Hand supporters demand the immediate release of their leader, Dragutin Dimitrijević. The obstinate refusal of the government to cooperate with the protesters, enraged the crowds, now ready to do justice on their own terms. The Prime Minister is now facing a difficult task. Should he repress these extremists using violence and risk to alienate the public opinion? Maybe it will be better for the king to return in the hopes that he may submit to the wise council of the ministers? Or maybe the situation will die down by letting our people express their right to free speech? Now in the champers of the Parliament, the fate of Serbia echoes loudly."
dhserbia.1.a:0 "All hail Nj.K.V. Aleksandar!"
dhserbia.1.b:0 "All hail Nj.K.V. Đorđe!"
dhserbia.1.c:0 "Send the Gendarmerie to them!"

dhserbia.2.d:0 "With the death of our dear leader, Apis, his wishes as stipulated by his will are to keep Serbia ruled by a military elite under the firm hand of Dragustin Keresovic who could enforce unity and readiness among the Serbian people for the next war with our mortal enemies. Civil dominance over military affairs weakened Serbia during the Weltkrieg and by upholding Apis wishes we will certainly prevail and free our Serbian brothers living under foreign control. But contradictory voices are calling for a return to a civil governance under Dimitrijie Ljotic who could maneuver diplomatically more easily by securing reliable allies and discourage Austrian intervention. Military governance could be seen from Vienna as a resurge in chauvinistic action and this could limit Serbia’s resolve in the next confrontation with Bulgaria. Both sides agree that a future conflict with our neighbors is inevitable, but which side of the argument will prevail?"
dhserbia.2.a:0 "Dragustin Keresovic and his junta prevail!"
dhserbia.2.b:0 "We need to be carefull, Dimitrije Ljotic is the new leader!"

dhserbia.3.t:0 "A New Constitution"
dhserbia.3.d:0 "A new Constitution for a new King! The social contract has been redefined by our benevolent king to encompass and promote the Serbian virtues and conservative values instilled in us by our ancestors.  In the fight against global syndicalism and foreign threats, the urgency of necessity must overcome other civil commodities. As such, the new constitution will discourage foreign subterfuges by dissolving the parliamentary menace that maintained instability in our country and enact press censorship over those papers that denigrate our national spirit. In a time where international relations are as tense as they have ever been, the must have unobstructed powers of actions over the legislative and executive branch of the government. The King assured his subjects that the most important matter at hand for our country is to mobilize and rebuild a culturally enriched Serbia ready to fight again the Goliath other foreign threats."
dhserbia.3.a:0 "Onwards to a new future!"

dhserbia.4.t:0 "A new economic model"
dhserbia.4.d:0 "For the past years some plans have been prepared for the implementation of a new economic and societal model that would keep the corruption of syndicalism away from Serbia, this system advocates for the organization of society by corporate groups, such as agricultural, labour, military, scientific, or guild associations on the basis of their common interests and it is believed that society will reach a peak of harmonious functioning when each of its divisions efficiently performs its designated function, such as a body's organs individually contributing its general health and functionality."
dhserbia.4.a:0 "Serbia will never fall to syndicalism!"

dhserbia.5.t:0 "Expand the funding for the Serbian Culture Club"
dhserbia.5.d:0 "The Serbian culture club has been an important center for many Serb intellectuals. The orginization, effective immedietley, will have  significant budget expansion. The club promotes the advance of Serbian national interest, and will be vital in establishing a Greater Serb state. It shall oversee the budget of the newspapers, our student wing the "White Eagles" and what to do with our songs and dances."
dhserbia.5.a:0 "For a better Serbia!"

dhserbia.6.t:0 "White Eagles"
dhserbia.6.d:0 "The "White Eagles" is the student wing of our movement, meant to shape the future of serbian youth into something great. There have been discussions for an entire week in order to see what kind of budget it shall be given to it, some have said that this is quite important and thus the funding should match it while others have said that it's doing well as it is and there's no need to give it anymore funds. Of course we could always stick to their normal funding and move on to our other issues to adress."
dhserbia.6.a:0 "Give them better funding!"
dhserbia.6.b:0 "The proposed funding is enough."
dhserbia.6.c:0 "Best use these funds somewhere else."

dhserbia.7.t:0 "The Status of our Newspapers"
dhserbia.7.d:0 "In order to rightfully guide our people, several administrative officials have proposed a funding boost to several newspaper orginizations with a lot of it going to the state's own "Fatherland". The newspapers have activley been very important to sway political opinions, and could be extremley useful in case of important national events."
dhserbia.7.a:0 "The people need to see our words no matter what!"
dhserbia.7.b:0 "The proposed funding is well enough for our purposes."
dhserbia.7.c:0 "The newspapers do well enough without our help."

dhserbia.8.t:0 "Songs and Dances"
dhserbia.8.d:0 "The Question of Songs and Dances has been brought to the culture club in order to be resolved and hopefully settled for a while. The question of what shall we do with our songs and dances, should we keep them truly traditional and unchanged or should we encourage some more creativity in combining more traditional elements of our music and dances with newer trends in order to create a new synthesis. Whichever option we pick it will surely have an influence in future music and dance makers."
dhserbia.8.a:0 "Maybe try to mix traditional elements together with modern elements?"
dhserbia.8.b:0 "Tradition is the bedrock to our society."

dhserbia.9.t:0 "The King's Men"
dhserbia.9.d:0 "It seems that the "King's Men" project has been a success and more people wish to join the program every new day. This, of course, raises a big problem , the "King's Men" are supposed to be elite troops trained to protect our king from harm or danger if we increase their numbers substancially it would make them more like a branch of the military and far less specialized then they are now. This problem has reached the highest levels of our government and it has been debated for days what the best course of action should be and the choice that has resulted from these discussions is..."
dhserbia.9.a:0 "The more the merrier!"
dhserbia.9.b:0 "The less there are the more specialized they can be."

dhserbia.10.t:0 "Our Volunteer Corps"
dhserbia.10.d:0 "It has been proposed that the ZBOR movement create it's own para-military unit in order to keep order on the streets of Serbia and to give the men some training for our future conflicts. The new unit will be under the command of Colonel Konstantin Mušicki and it will consist of 12 companies, each 120-150 men strong. Of course as this is a volunteer organization we shall not force anyone to join it and the only reason one might is if it wishes to fight for it's homeland or wishes to unite it. However the question remains: what kind of funding should we give to this organization?"
dhserbia.10.a:0 "Give it substancial funding."
dhserbia.10.b:0 "A small portion over the standard funding should work."
dhserbia.10.c:0 "Standard funding should be more than enough."

dhserbia.11.t:0 "Death of our King"
dhserbia.11.d:0 "Alexander II, our King, has died in his sleep. A week of mourning has been declared, however the question of a new king still lingers, who shall be the new king? Should it be Prince Peter the heir apparent or should it prince George the one who his loyal to our cause?"
dhserbia.11.a:0 "Long Live King Peter!"
dhserbia.11.a:0 "Long Live King George!"

dhserbia.15.t:0 "The Great Serbian History"
dhserbia.15.d:0 "Serbian history is one of the most interesting stories one would be able to hear in his life, or so it is said in our schools. For the past days there have been meetings about how should we showcase serbian history and more importantly how should we present this history in a way that it inspires people to be like their forefathers brave and courageous. There have been 3 proposed projects for an exhibition to be held in Belgrade with various budgetary needs that will surely influence our people to be proud of their heritage. These projects are: "The warrior exhibition" where it is showcased our great warrior spirit, "The Church exhibition" where it is showcased how we have kept our faith despite being under the heel of others, and the last one being a more general exhibition. Which one should we greenlight?"
dhserbia.15.a:0 "The warrior exhibition of course!"
dhserbia.15.b:0 "The church one seems interesting."
dhserbia.15.c:0 "The middle of the road is always best and cheapest."

dhserbia.12.t:0 "Accusations of Syndicalism"
dhserbia.12.d:0 "Due to our new economic and societal model resembling syndicalism in a few areas there has been a pushback against it and the government has been accused of being secretly syndicalists who wish to make Serbia in a syndicalist stronghold in the balkans in order to be used in taking down our neighbouring empires. Such accusations are preposterous and inside the parliament the voices call for the silecing of such slander."
dhserbia.12.a:0 "Silence these fools!"

dhserbia.13.t:0 "The Black General"
dhserbia.13.d:0 "Many arguments pro and against the will of Apis have been had and it has finally been decided that a junta will be the best course of action at the moment. The parliament of Serbia shall be abolished and all actions the new military government shall be held accountable by the king to prevent any abuse of power and it shall give back the powers back to a civilian government after the times of danger have passed."
dhserbia.13.a:0 "The army shall bring us stability in these trying times."

dhserbia.14.t:0 "The Serbian State proclamation"
dhserbia.14.d:0 "A new emergengy constitution has been created in order to solidify the legitimacy of the new regime but also in order to give some peace of mind to those who think that our government will soon be couped or deposed by some other force that seeks to control the serbian state. The constitution stipulates that the military government will be held accountable to the king and that it will be dissolved soon after the dangers against the state have passsed."
dhserbia.14.a:0 "Onwards Serbian people, onwards to your destiny!"

dhserbia.16.t:0 "A pushback against our new society"
dhserbia.16.d:0 "The new constitution seems to have sparked some outrage amidst the population thinking that this situation will only get worse and that the politics of people have surpassed the needs of the people. Both the king and the black general have held speeches reassuring the population that this constitution is only temporary and that the situation will soon return to the one before the austrian occupation after the Weltkrieg and while it seems that these speeches have calmed some people some are still doubtful of the our new regime."
dhserbia.16.a:0 "People need to realize that those measures are temporary!"

dhserbia.17.t:0 "A Youth Wing To Form"
dhserbia.17.d:0 "One of the projects that the civilian part of our movement was the formation and expansion of a youth wing which would've formed the children of our people into great serbian men and women. This idea has been evaluated by our staff and it was concluded that this would bring some stability to our regime and even the king seemed to approve of the idea wholeheartedly."
dhserbia.17.a:0 "We can only hope this will be sufficient."

dhserbia.18.t:0 "A show of might"
dhserbia.18.d:0 "This day has been scheduled for a simple military drill however some of our upper staff has decided that this is a great oportunity to show that the serbs have returned and they are as strong as ever. The proposed plan is to turn the military drill into a great public parade that will hopefully attract the attention of our neighbors, of course there's the posibility of such a show being ignored by them however it will still be a great morale boost to our people."
dhserbia.18.a:0 "We shall see what results this has garnered us."

dhserbia.19.t:0 "A statue for Apis"
dhserbia.19.d:0 "While some have been against the idea, it has been decided that in honor of the great king maker Dragutin Dimitrijević, also known as Apis, that a statue in his likeness shall be erected in Belgrade. People fear that this decision might anger the austrians since they see him as one of the killers of Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand however such claims will remain as nothing but claims as there is no actual proof of a connection between Gavrilo Princip's assassination and Apis."
dhserbia.19.a:0 "A great statue for our great hero."

dhserbia.20.t:0 "The illyrian socialists"
dhserbia.20.d:0 "It has come to our attention that with our gains in the west that many socialist elements from the former country known as Illyria is plaguing our newly formed nation and thus must be put down.

dhserbia.20.a:0 "Damn them all!"

dhserbia.21.t:0 "Joseph Bronz Tito I presume"
dhserbia.21.d:0 "Through clever tactics and cunning General Mihailović has managed to capture a huge number of partisans among them being one man called Joseph Bronz Tito. This man has been rumoured to be the leader of these socialist rebels however the Serbian high command regarded him as more of a mythical figure, now however, present in flesh and bone the general thinks it’s best to make an example of him and some of his closest supporters, as such he has requested a trial and should the verdict be execution to be the man that pulls the trigger."
dhserbia.21.a:0 "So long socialist dog."

dhserbia.22.t:0 "Our Brothers Need Help"
dhserbia.22.d:0 "Our Brothers under the Austrian heel have contacted us in order to aid them in escaping their clutches. The king and it's council have been in talks in what our best course of action is and what consequences in taking them will. After a few days of delibaration it has been accepted that our best course of action is..."
dhserbia.22.a:0 "Offering them our full support."
dhserbia.22.b:0 "Offering them limited assitance."
dhserbia.22.c:0 "Giving them funds is the best we can do."

dhserbia.23.t:0 "Our Brothers Have responded"
dhserbia.23.d:0 "Offering our brothers the full support of the Serbian state seemed to be the right call as now we have a powerful ally in them and they can help in the fight against the enemies that seek to destroy whatever is left of the Serbian identity."

dhserbia.24.t:0 "Our Brothers Have responded"

dhserbia.25.t:0 "Our Brothers Have responded"
